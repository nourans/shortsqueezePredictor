It's posted three 20%+ jumps this week and I know they inked a deal with Walmart and were possibly doing one with Toyota, so that could be why it's going up, but is there a ceiling to this? If it seems like a legit long term company, I guess I'll stick around, but I kinda got burned by CERS a couple weeks ago assuming it'd continue to rise slowly before it tanked. 

This however has me intrigued. I mean if I lose, whatever, but it is nice to see one of my stocks go up 90% since I purchased. "

PLUG now trades at a cool $1 Billion valuation with virtually no assets on the balance sheet and what looks to be a low gross margin product in the near term.  I'm not saying the tech isn't real and I know better than to bet against a stock with this sort of momentum but with FCEL and PLUG reporting this week, I have to believe they will disappoint in terms of the expectations that are now priced into the stock.  That is all.

I was in long before this crazy spike - but to see a 100% +/- swing in one day is out of this world. 

I personally have confidence in this company. Lots of positive news, supposed profitable quarter. But a 40% dip in one day should cause everyone to pause and evaluate. 

Selling after such a large dip is not in my blood. So my question is what can we reasonably expect in the next month, year and 5 years?

Seems to me like this company can still do some serious things and is well positioned to capitalize, but man oh man 40+% on paper for one position in one day is no fun! "

Tried to break $5 3 or 4 times previously in the last month but couldn't. With an announcement of debt reduction, along with a big ER, SP could skyrocket. If debt is reduced in any meaningful way, no chance this is only a $4-$5 stock after another solid earnings report, which is likely with the increase in NG and oil prices. 

DD: They made $9.23B in the last year with $1.1B in earnings. They've destroyed earnings each of the last 2 quarters, and last quarter had earnings of 34 cents a share, on a $4 stock. What's up with that? The only thing keeping this share price down is the amount of debt. Any progress on that end could send it much higher, and the CEO has said that the common shareholder would be rewarded this year. 

$6 and $7 calls a few months out are still cheap. Personally, Im trying to hit a homerun with some $9 August calls, but I also have September $6 which I'm extremely confident in.

Institutional investors have doubled their positions by millions of shares and all eight of its board members have purchase shares four times since the beginning of the year.

&amp;#x200B;

**DD**:

WSB listen up - Plug power is going to pop soon with a price target of $3.57, a 90% increase over its current price for the near term tendies. It will increase over the next quarter further as it completes its transition from research company to viable manufacturing company. I have 155 $3 11/16 calls for the near term tendies based around its 11/8 earning report, which I'll then turn over to 3/15 calls for the long term tendies where I expect it will jump yet further.

Walmart, Amazon, Nike, and FedEx have opened contracts with Plug Power for hydrogen powered forklifts and vehicles. Hydrogen power might seem lame but their niche is in industrial forklifts and local deliveries where time spent recharging is thousands of dollars a minute. Their CEO Andy Marsh has also been named to the U.S. Department of Energy Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technical Advisory Committee, giving the business the political connections it needs to succeed. Jonathan Silver, a member of the board of directors, is also a former US Department of Energy official. They are also pursuing European expansion to become an international company, where the political connections will offer them an advantage over their competitor Bloom Energy.

All eight of the board members have purchased hundreds of thousands of shares in the company four times since the beginning of the year, most recently in late August, signalling that they see a positive future for the company as it has turned around from a research company to a viable industrial and manufacturing business. Institutional investors have increased their stakes by millions of shares - Odey Asset Management Group Ltd bough an additional 2,330,000 shares increasing their stake in the company to 4,910,000 shares. Ignore the misleading title of the article and read content for a breakdown of the institutional investor increases: ([https://www.fairfieldcurrent.com/2018/09/23/insider-selling-plug-power-inc-nasdaqplug-director-sells-31343-shares-of-stock.html](https://www.fairfieldcurrent.com/2018/09/23/insider-selling-plug-power-inc-nasdaqplug-director-sells-31343-shares-of-stock.html))

This is also different than a vehicle running on LPG or other alternative fuel. The hydrogen isn't burned in the traditional sense, but is instead run through a membrane that strips the electrons from hydrogen using a catalyst and generates electricity directly from the reaction - the hydrogen then bonds with available oxygen and generates water as a byproduct. The advantage of this type of system is the reduced refueling/recharging time compared to traditional electric forklifts that are used in warehouses, and the reduced emissions compared to traditionally powered forklifts. Their systems are retrofit-capable and can be fitted to currently owned electric forklifts, reducing the overhead of purchasing all-new equipment.

They have also in-sourced the production of the membrane electrode assemblies to further reduce costs ([https://www.gasworld.com/interview-with-plug-power-ceo/2015463.article](https://www.gasworld.com/interview-with-plug-power-ceo/2015463.article)) and opened a new almost 40k SQFT factory in Rochester New York ([https://dailygazette.com/article/2018/08/15/plug-power-adds-factory-in-clifton-park](https://dailygazette.com/article/2018/08/15/plug-power-adds-factory-in-clifton-park)). They used to purchase their membranes for their equipment from their competitor Bloom Energy, and now that they are producing their own membranes they have announced two new pieces of technology - a new membrane that doubles the energy output of its fuel cell system, and their partnership with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the US DOE to develop a robotic fueling station and reduces the time needed to refuel and allows the the usage of autonomous warehouse equipment powered by its system.

I've seen mixed analysis reviews, as with all stocks, but looking at their chart, for 11/16, it looks like they're due for decent spike. Today they just increased revenue guidance:

"" For the full year of 2018, Plug Power has increased gross revenue guidance to between $175 million and $190 million (1). This compares to the previously forecasted revenue range of $155 million to $180 million. ""

[https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Plug+Power+%28PLUG%29+Raises+FY+Revenue+Guidance/14708178.html](https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Plug+Power+%28PLUG%29+Raises+FY+Revenue+Guidance/14708178.html)

So, since October 10th, they've had a nice little jump of about 8%, with earnings coming up 11/14. Based on previous charts, too, I'm betting on more of a jump this time around."

You're damn right it's going to pump all the way up and then dump harder and with less liquidity than a prolapsing esophagus falling out of your sphincter. Probably even good brokers won't be able to execute. There are few algos buying this - and even if they are, the spreads are about to be massive.

Following yesterday‘s call, Today to analysts increased their price target to $8, and one analyst increased price target to $14

It seems to me PLUG has the most advanced fuel cell engines, as well as the most experience and scale for hydrogen generation and infrastructure.  PLUG has the deepest patent portfolio related to everything hydrogen and fuel cell, so it’s very difficult for new entrants to bypass.

NKLA Should be working with PLUG accelerate their plan for electric and fuel cell trucks, and take advantage of PLUG existing hydrogen fueling infrastructure.  This can be achieved by partnering, joint venture, or straight acquisition of PLUG."

My personal opinion is that this is only the beginning of Plug Power’s stocks rise.  Both the technology and cost of Fuel cell and EV are reality today, just see purchases and interests in Tesla and Nikola.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/plug-power-ceo-andy-marsh-172532379.html
 
Excerpt:
“We were introduced to Lightning Systems, which has done BEVs with Amazon as well as fuel cell electric vehicles. Amazon not only is one of our largest customers, but also is a shareholder of Plug Power. So they've introduced us to Lightning Systems.

They will be putting on the road this year — both in North America and Europe — hydrogen-powered trucks powered by our fuel cells. “"

I've been staring out the window for hours today at the trees and birds with melancholy and regret, I can't even muster up energy to call my Mom to say hi because all I think about is dolla signs and she's a distraction to my WSB dd and cocaine use. 

To cope with the tendies left in the oven time and time again on TSLA I just need to post some PLUG gains on some LEAPS I bought for emotional support. I'm just starting to fucks with LEAPS on speculative companies like PLUG and NIO (which I also fucking sold 2 weeks ago or some shit). 

I've made a lot of money over the past 2 years but sometimes I can't get over the tendies left on the table and I just need to rail cocaine and log into pornhub to deal with stress, like I could;ve made more money and bought better cocaine you know? I don't think people understand the hardships that come with this life. I've been trading options for 2 years and I feel like I've aged 20 years already.

Those 7/2 1000c's were worth like $214.00 each according to TOS as I check now. So I sold the bunch for $26k but worth $214k now. Blah blah you never know and always take gains but this is probably the 5th time specifically on TSLA where my tissue hands left $50k+ on the table. That being said I live in California so I need at least 1 mil to put a down payment on 350 sqft studio here if I want to be a homeowner. Such is life.

This product has incredible potential. In fact, I’d say the sky really is the limit.” Here is the PR that I found this statement. It PRed yesterday but no major news source is covering YET.

I have also noticed an uptick in hydrogen cell production as well as an uptick in electrical storage facilities. They are preparing to do a big play on expansion is what I am feeling many new ipos in the motor industry as well as the energy industry are using renewable energy and I believe this is the reason for the uptick in activity.

I have concluded with extensive research and with some analysis that this stock could go as high as 25$ or even 30$ placing the value of this company at a whopping 10B-13B Market Cap.

Morgan Stanley upgrades Plug Power to Overweight on rapid growth potential As previously reported, Morgan Stanley analyst Stephen Byrd upgraded Plug Power to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $14, up from $10.25, following the company's investor day symposium. The event highlighted upside potential from several areas, including fuel cell vehicle sales to Linde, the Apex partnership to secure cheap U.S. renewable power, ""several avenues of growth"" in Europe, and Plug's strong progress in electrolyzer technology, according to Byrd, who now factors in a higher long-term growth rate for Plug Power.

Internally, Plug has presented an ""aggressive"" investment &amp; expansion plan, which includes a  new factory and driving down material costs by 50%.

Most analysts will tell you it's grossly overvalued, PLUG still has negativily performing earnings (that they miss), and all of the insider transactions since the start of October (going into earnings) have been the CFOs and directors selling everything thats not nailed down

+ Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer assigned a Buy rating to Plug Power, with a price target of $23.00. 

+ H.C. Wainwright analyst Amit Dayal maintained a Buy rating on Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) on Tuesday, setting a price target of $30, which is approximately 47.71% above the present share price of $20.31.

+ Craig-Hallum analyst Eric Stine raised the firm's price target on Plug Power to $26 from $14 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst cites the company's Q3 beat, raised fiscal year 2020 guidance and maintained outlooks for 2021/2024.

+ Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin raised the firm's price target on Plug Power to $22 from $13 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst notes that Plug posted ""strong"" Q3 upside, with revenue and EBITDA ahead by $15.5M and $14.5M, respectively. However, Q4 implied guide was below estimates, reflecting seasonal Q3 deliveries strength at key customers, Irwin adds. The analyst believes much of the material long-term value creation at Plug will come from FC trucks and green hydrogen, and both of these initiatives remain on track. He would buy on any weakness.

+ B. Riley Securities analyst Christopher Souther raised the firm's price target on Plug Power to $24 from $18 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares following the company's ""strong"" Q3 results. Management continues to execute well in material handling and is very bullish on adjacent market opportunities in backup power and commercial vehicles where ramps are likely to begin early to middle of next year, Souther tells investors in a research note.

+ Barclays analyst Moses Sutton raised the price target on Plug Power (NASDAQ: PLUG) to $21.00 (from $13.00) while maintaining a Overweight rating.

Did you buy calls at the top just to yell ""fuck this scam, useless pos"" and then buy puts again at the bottom?

Are you so wound up on anti-depressants and fomo that you just need to yolo something?

Look no further the PLUG train is here.

After moving up 15% today alone, you best believe the tendies are coming.

Clean energy bubble, hydrogen energy, and a bunch of horndog banks looking to milk this baby into the clean energy bubble, this is your opportunity.

This stock is diluted as fuck with almost 400 million shares now, but guess what I don't give a fuck that means more retards to buy more shares to push me out of poverty.

In the wise words of Jared Vennett, ""I smell money""

I  will not sell and you will kick yourself when I rub this post in your face at the end of the year and PLUG is 40+.

I am yet to take a position but would like to know all of your opinions.

Pacific Ethanol produces food, animal feed, renewable gasses and *industrial alcohols* 

The stock is up 795% this year, but analysts consensus is that it should reach 16.50 in about a years time, and it has a strong buy consensus. 

“Investors should note that management indicated that though the company has a firm visibility on pricing, specialty alcohol volumes delivered to customers could vary on a quarterly basis. Given that sanitizers are a key end-market for specialty alcohols, the stock has come under some pressure with positive COVID-19 vaccine related news. However, we believe demand for sanitizer products should remain elevated with increase in any economic activity in the near term. We believe the improved balance sheet and cash flow is allowing the company to make investments in areas of the business that have been previously overlooked, and may have been under-contributing as a result,”"

This company will be worth trillions by 2030

Understand that PLUG’s fuel cells already power thousands of commercial equipment such as forklifts and other supply chain hydraulic equipment. Seen a whole lot of people that think fuel cells don’t work, but I can assure you, it’s not the EV competitors that keep Elon Musk awake at night, it’s Andy Marsh and Plug Power. 

PLUG will be providing hydrogen units to power vehicles in the mid 2021, are prepared to assist OEM’s in installation and service (four major OEM’s confirmed and purchased). In other words, cars on the road in months, not years. But cars are just a side project for PLUG. 

That’s right, cars are not even the main focus of this company, they are about to control the whole green hydrogen supply chain, and I’m going to break it down for you simply. I’ve been periodically rolling over options since PLUG was at $6, and it’s going to be my early retirement. 

Here’s why: 

1) Hydrogen power allows for instant refueling, and is optimized for engine sizes on long distance hauling compared to electric- yep, this means clean energy that you don’t have to charge. This means hydrogen can be used for planes, and logistically is the best choice for trucking. 

2) Plug power doesn’t just do cars and engines they also control the refueling stations. They already have a refueling line all along the east coast of the US. For those that purchase their drive units. 

3) They are the the main processor and distributor of green hydrogen, and are investing highly in its production 

4) They have developed large scale commercial power stations (the size of a tennis court) that can generate enough energy to manage major data and cloud businesses. This is the first efficient and green independent energy source ever created. This could would allow you to put a Walmart in the Sahara Desert, and it also means you don’t need to run electrical utilities from the grid to the business. 


The Issues: 

1)first off understand that there is already electrical infrastructure across nearly the entire world. This is not a reality with hydrogen, which is why PLUG is so dedicated to building fueling stations right now. 

2) The next and main problem with PLUG power isn’t whether hydrogen works, it does, the problem is with making it a 100% clean energy, or green hydrogen. Right now most hydrogen comes from the separation and purification process of natural gasses, which is considered a dirty process, making that hydrogen not classified as green hydrogen. In order to achieve 100% green hydrogen, they must process hydrogen using solar and other forms of clean energy processes. PLUG and it’s associates in the sector must build a strong enough infrastructure in order to process and distribute enough green hydrogen to drop the price of clean hydrogen to a competitive price with other clean energy forms. 
Plug power is solving this, and well on its way to making, processing, and distributing enough clean hydrogen to drop the price of clean hydrogen to make it competitive with the price of electricity

With big moves being made to clean energy, PLUG is perfectly positioned and is a necessity for businesses that can’t stop moving to charge their equipment, and to get clean, commercial level power to areas that you can’t or isn’t financially feasible to run electrical utilities. Plug power is going to be one of the largest energy distributors in the world by 2030.  

They control nearly every bit of the process of bringing clean hydrogen to their own products, and control all the infrastructure. Best Buy you could ever make.

Here are my roll over positions, total of around 1300% : [Positions](https://imgur.com/gallery/HXqWcrn)

Edit of Edit: I’m not telling anyone that right now is the best time to buy weekly call options on PLUG. The reason I’m doing this is because I’ve come a crossed a variety of posts saying fuel cells don’t even work, along with a lot of incorrect, misinformation. I’m trying to explain simply what the company is doing outside of vehicles and because the engineering behind fuel cells, in addition to bringing hydrogen vehicles to the road is unquestionably more challenging then electric. However it actually opens up the ability for green aerospace, trucking and 24/7 commercial business. (Like Walmart and Amazon, two of PLUGs customers)"

PLUG POWER RAISES APPROXIMATELY $1B TO ACCELERATE THE FIRST NATION-WIDE GREEN HYDROGEN NETWORK
11/24/20
Download this Press ReleasePDF Format (opens in new window)
LATHAM, N.Y., Nov. 24, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ: PLUG), a leading provider of hydrogen engines and fueling solutions enabling e-mobility, has successfully completed one of the largest bought equity deal transactions in the broader clean-tech sector. This marks Plug Power’s largest capital raise in the Company’s history with approximately $1 billion of capital, bringing total cash post-closing balance to $1.7 billion. The capital raise uniquely positions Plug Power to execute and accelerate on its green hydrogen strategy as well as other strategic growth initiatives.
Plug Power recently announced its plans to build five regional green hydrogen facilities in the United States. The Company will continue to work with strategic partners, including Apex Clean Energy and Brookfield Renewable, to source low-cost renewable power. The combination of low-cost renewables, strong capital position, and in house electrolyzer and liquefaction technology all uniquely position Plug Power to build out this green hydrogen network. Furthermore, Plug Power has already become the largest user of liquid hydrogen with its internal demand increasing from current 40TPD (tons per day), to 100TPD by 2024.The first two green hydrogen plants are expected to be operational in 2022. All five plants are expected to be operational by 2024, with a total capacity of 100TPD. This would constitute the country's first nationwide green hydrogen network. The green hydrogen generated by this network will support the mission to decarbonize the broader transportation and logistics industries, a mission shared by both Plug Power and its customers. The Company's unmatched industry position as a total solutions provider will also help facilitate the anticipated rapid growth of the hydrogen economy. According to consultancy McKinsey &amp; Company, the global hydrogen economy could reach $2.5 trillion by 2050, representing 18% of the global energy demand.“We are very pleased with the reception from the institutional investors and the market resulting in a meaningfully upsized capital raise. This ideally positions Plug Power to accelerate the growth of the green hydrogen economy in the United States and globally, a job we wholeheartedly accept,” said Andy Marsh, CEO of Plug Power. “Green hydrogen provides one of the lowest carbon emission solutions from a wells-to-wheels perspective serving a variety of different industries.”“We have identified several locations working with strategic partners where we can produce green hydrogen at parity with grey hydrogen and see further opportunities to reduce the cost of green hydrogen. Furthermore, this recently completed capital raise and in house capabilities ideally positions us to accelerate the build out of this green hydrogen network,” said Sanjay Shrestha, Chief Strategy Officer and head of Plug Power’s green hydrogen generation business.

On top of that options pool activity showed a shit ton of calls bought and alot of puts sold today. All day just bullish call activity. News coming sometime next week. Maybe Monday. Tomorrow above $36. Notice the $36 puts sold expiring tommorow. Could test 52 week highs

[https://imgur.com/Q6BU5fR](https://imgur.com/Q6BU5fR)

As majority of people believe that AMC is going bankrupt soon in january but I believe that they will be saved. Either a buyout or something else. News coming soon. Today the stock hit close to its 52 week lows and looking at the daily chart all the way from march, I believe today was the bottom and should go back up. Also Smart money bought alot of call options for march 2021 and 2022 - $2.5  and $8 calls respectively. Someone believes this will go back up soon. Too big to fail but trade carefully.

48,2021-01-12,Why PLUG is a self-perpetuating fantasy that cannot last forever.,u/Flamboyant4Lyfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kvuev6/why_plug_is_a_selfperpetuating_fantasy_that/,"Ok... let me explain.

I briefly worked as an intern in the Hydrogen fuel industry in 2019. This, in turn, led me to invest a good sum of my earnings in Tesla, as I had thought I had a good understanding of the EV industry.

First let me explain what solution Hydrogen is the answer to. I firmly believe it is not the answer to energy *production*, but possibly one day for storage. Hydrogen is not found naturally on Earth. It requires loads of energy, typically through hydrolysis (remember high school chemistry?) in order to isolate H2.

Second, Fuel Cell technology is years and years behind battery technology in recent years. Check out how daddy [elon](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/21/musk-calls-hydrogen-fuel-cells-stupid-but-tech-may-threaten-tesla.html) feels about them. There are many additional factors that affect fuel cell functionality, such as air quality and temperature. These limitations are much less severe for batteries.

Also, look at the state of development of the two technologies. EVs are becoming more and more popular every year. Honda and Hyundai each have Hydrogen fuel cells on the market, but you never hear of or see them. Ever see a hydrogen gas refill station? Nope. They barely exist outside of Cali.

Now, I understand much of the idea behind Hydrogen Technology is what's in store for the future, but what about batteries? In what world will we suddenly ditch these very successful batteries that work extremely efficiently today for fuel cells that run on hydrogen that may work well in 20 years?

Previously I said Hydrogen is not the answer for energy production, but maybe one day storage. Though storage is difficult and a pain in the ass, Hydrogen energy can be stored and shipped in tanks. One day, if we eventually as a country have so much excess energy that we can simply perform hydrolysis on water and store the excess hydrogen in a vat, then hydrogen may be the answer. Until then, I see no answer, whether scientific or economic, that would explain further returns for PLUG.

Sorry if this post wasn't autistic enough for this sub, I'm kinda new here.

EDIT: Why is it self perpetuating? Investors see people getting great returns in the hydrogen fuel industry. People speculate and say things like ""it's the fuel of the future"" without really understanding or knowing much about the industry, and since so many financial institutions end up following this mantra, it in turn attracts more and more people to invest. Regardless of profits today, and regardless of decent understanding of the tech. Also, hydrogen tech peaked around 2000 in part via comments made by the Bush admin about investing in hydrogen tech. Plug reached 1k+ in 2000 and since dropped to &lt;100. Doesn't sound great."

I've been lurking for some time, finally made an account on Reddit a month ago (not a boomer, I just don't use much social media or related websites) and now I can post. As many of you are probably watching right now, PLUG just flew up to 71.20 AH, and will probably continue its climb as we approach Biden's inauguration. Like many of you, I saw it a week ago in the 30s, watched it soar, and got too scared to FOMO in.

However, a fellow retard dropped the ticker ""BLDP"" in the daily comment section about a week ago, and I decided to YOLO in and buy some Jan15 30C and Feb19 32C. Surely enough, the retard came through, and the stock soared. Nothing too crazy, but daily returns comparable to FCEL/PLUG. Next thing I know, I wake up this morning and find out that my BLDP calls were +500% and +300, respectively, so I ran to the wife's bedroom, asked her boyfriend to help me clean the shit out of my pants that the 5-bagger caused, and then I paper handed and sold for some fat gains (will provide screenshots if people like). Throughout the day, it was sideways with a couple dips, so sure enough, I YOLO'd back in for some Jan15 35C and Feb19 40C.

Now, here we are, and although PLUG may be up 8% AH and everyone is scared to FOMO in, BLDP is only up 7.71% AH (a steal, I know), and it's only going higher. Don't be the paper handed pussy that your wife hates and her boyfriend laughs at. BLDP is heading to the fucking moon \*moon emoji\* \*moon emoji\* \*moon emoji\* \*moon emoji\*, and then to Mars from there. Oh, did I mention that PLUG and FCEL have daily volumes of 90M+, while BLDP is still under 20M? Just wait for the boomers to find out about it....

Anyways, I don't really have any DD, so do with this information what you will. I'm going to diamond hands this shit like I am with my ICLN, and Biden is going to take me straight to tendie town.

TLDR; My positions are BLDP Jan15 35C and Feb19 40C. TBH, it'll probably hit 40 tomorrow or Thursday, once Biden's frail voice hypes up the future of energy.

Edit: Someone asked for tendies, so here you are sir.

Plug Power rises on Renault venture while GM reveals flying car. Is Tesla going to crush Apple? Let’s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market posting small gains, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/V2Yn5xJ) leading the way, up .28%, the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/hMpFmmF) gaining 60 points and the [SP500](https://ibb.co/YLYfs4V) finishing flat for the day, just about 3800, while the [VIX](https://ibb.co/sgR88nB) posted a 3% decline, though it seemed it was going to go back into higher volatility territory in the middle of the day

We also saw almost 70% of [companies](https://ibb.co/vHBQThL) advancing with 260 new highs on about average volume as 6 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/7pwD88M) finished in the green, with Energy leading the way yet again &amp; continuing to outperform in 2021, while Health Care and Communications lost more than 1%, with Large-Cap Growth Companies being the biggest laggard, also continuing the huge underperformance compared to all other factors, as small &amp; mid-caps have largely [outperformed](https://ibb.co/QH694Vc) since the start of the year.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/2Kt4ChR) from yesterday, with most big tech companies losing ground, though Tesla did recover after an 8% plunge on Monday and was also joined by the Banks, the Semiconductors and the Oil &amp; Gas companies.

Yesterday we also got some economic data, with the Small Business Optimism [INDEX](https://ibb.co/12TgvbS) falling sharply to 95.9 in December, vs the 102 expected and 101.4 in the previous month, as the small business optimism has continued to drop after the highs it made in September, while job [OPENINGS](https://ibb.co/S0VG5PZ) came pretty much in line with the previous report at 6.52M, as the openings rate remained double the quits rate. And in some better news we saw the worldwide semiconductor [MARKET](https://ibb.co/8NZ79p7) gaining 7% year over year to reach $39.4B for November, as the world will keep on needing more &amp; more semiconductors with improving technology, I really like this sector and I believe it’s one of the best for long-term investing.

[Today](https://ibb.co/s3c5sMQ) we start the day off with the MBA Mortgage Applications, Consumer Price Index and finish the day with the Treasury Budget and the FED’s Beige Book.

While in the IPO world, we will see [AFFIRM](https://ibb.co/6WqTmZX) start trading today, as the company set the final IPO price at $49 way above the first and second ranges between 33-44$. I really am interested in this company thought it’s unlikely we will see shares available to retail traders under 60-70$ in my opinion, while in the M&amp;A department, we saw [VISA](https://ibb.co/CVkG87d) terminate the merger agreement with Plaid a year after the first announcement of the proposed transaction.

In some other stock market [NEWS](https://ibb.co/VBYhdY1), we saw Boeing land a $1.7B Air Force contract. This is good news for Boeing, as the commercial airlines business will be struggling at least for a couple of years until they ramp up the MAX production &amp; airline traffic demand goes back close to the levels seen before 2020, which might happen with more easily scalable vaccines coming soon from the likes of [JNJ](https://ibb.co/VCpS3Kw), while they also did suffer another hit with a plane crash in Asia, though it’s not expected to be from a manufacturing defect, but [RATHER](https://ibb.co/Y2TZtNK) by the lax maintenance in the 9months the airplane was grounded last year.

We also saw Plug Power [skyrocket](https://ibb.co/3yChM7R) yet again, finishing the day up over 20% after the announcement of a hydrogen venture with Renault. This joint venture is [expected](https://ibb.co/LhFHnrX) to lead to further developments in fuel cell &amp; hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, that will be based on Renaults platforms, as the companies will combine the manufacturing capabilities of the OEM with the fuel cell &amp; hydrogen system knowledge from Plug Power. It’s expected they will also provide refueling stations to help the ecosystem, in an effort to offer vertical integration with vehicles, fueling stations, services &amp; selling hydrogen fuel to customers. It’s seems a good &amp; interesting development, but I would avoid buying it after such a huge [SPIKE](https://ibb.co/WkGwC79), it should have somewhat of a small pullback sometime soon.

In the Automobile world we also saw GM making a big splash at CES, with announcements of a big [PUSH](https://ibb.co/swv4wn3) into electric vans, a new Venture called BrightDrop that will develop even more electric-powered machinery and the surprise reveal of a [FLYING](https://ibb.co/G5bP3YX) Cadillac, while [TESLA](https://ibb.co/W2H1xrc) just registered its Indian entity just as ARK’s Invest CEO [NOTED](https://ibb.co/qWjZqmF) that Tesla is still way ahead of Apple by taking a page from their own playbook when developing their own chips for the autonomous vehicles. I personally believe that there is enough room for both companies to exist in this new EV path by mostly crushing other traditional OEMs which aren’t good enough at adopting this new trend like Nissan &amp; others.

We also saw Walmart adding even more news on the back of the [FINTECH](https://ibb.co/DVKSgGb) startup, as they are also planning on experimenting with even [MORE](https://ibb.co/g7qgstZ) delivery options, as the company seems to be trying to innovate as much as possible to increase the efficiency, as they try to compete as much as possible with online-purpose [RETAILERS](https://ibb.co/YjMjDLw) that are high flying yet again.

And one last piece of [NEWS](https://ibb.co/zQBd1L5), is that we saw a report that suggests the iPhone 12 sold 18M units in China in the last quarter of 2020, exceeding all expectations and more than doubling their market share from 10% to over 20%, thus delivering a hit to Asian manufacturers of smartphones. This is exactly what I expected as the new iPhone 12 lineup should be a hit around the world, with many loyal Apple brand followers switching to the 5G technology and to the better camera capabilities. This will also help Apple increase the services business revenue streams, as an increased devices base will lead to increased services usage.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as both the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/HB5P34r) Markets and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/BgwpqT8) are mixed, with the Nasdaq posting to a small open gain.

First thing that happens this morning, price target raised to $79 from $52 for Plug Power. He said analysts see something positive, raise the price target and then the market proves them right.

And then went on to joke how analysts are just going to keep increasing the Tesla price target and how every morning analysts are going to randomly scream new price targets such as $1000 and then £1200. Most of them just to keep up with the stock price 😂🚀

Let’s hope this keeps happening for Plug, Tesla and all others! 🚀🚀🚀"

Alright, shut the fuck up about GME for a second and Im gonna make you money. y'all heard alot about PLUG from a few places as of late. Yes, it has exploded 135% in the last month alone but it isn't over. Right now, the sentiment is bearish and I agree in the short term, but long term PLUG is only going to keep growing. There are a few key points I want to highlight.

PLUG is single-highhandedly the largest hydrogen-fuel-cell titan in the industry. 20 years of industry under its belt, it now services Amazon with 40,000 active forklifts and Walmart uses roughly 10,000 active vehicles. Now, they are partnering with two more titans. Renault and SK Group. The French and South Korean markets respectively. First, Renault. Renault is well established in France, and is backed by the government itself. The deal with Renault is HUGE for plug in the European market. **The two plan to establish an innovation center for development of fuel cell technology in LCV vehicles** ***for*** **future Renault platforms. Initially, heavy vans and utility. They plan on combining manufacturing with Renault, establishing a vertically integrated fuel cell stack system and a manufacturing center in France. Expansion of refueling systems to accommodate the new market. The deal will only accelerate in the future as Renault plans to adopt Plug Power technology in commercial fleets.** Why is Renault Interested? Well, the EU announced a plan calling for Europe to have at least six gigawatts of renewable hydrogen electrolyzers by 2024 (A critical period for PLUG for a few more reasons) and the production of up to 1 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen. Doable, sure, but the bigger picture is this:

This is almost exactly how the rise of the solar industry happened. EU plans into the future. The European Union unveiled a plan this month to invest hundreds of billions of euros in technologies enabling it to get a substantial share of its energy from hydrogen by 2050. This is potentially **insane**.

([https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/hydrogen\_strategy.pdf](https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/hydrogen_strategy.pdf))

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Second group. SK Group is planning to invest 1.5 billion USD in an intention to form a joint venture next year. The goal is to provide South Korea (and later a possibility of the larger Asian Market) hydrogen fuel cell systems. Particularly, Infrastructure and electrolyzers (power stations, basically). There is, however, no information if PLUG is planning on directly partnering with any manufacturers in Korea. (I will get to this later). Why is SK Group interested in Plug? Plans call to build a liquid hydrogen plant with an annual capacity of 30,000 tons in Incheon in **2023**, to be scaled up to 280,000 tons in **2025**. The South Korean government's commitment to shift the to Hydrogen with 729 Million dollars this year. A 30% increase from last year.

([https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/060120-asian-countries-accelerate-hydrogen-plans-with-policies-and-projects](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/060120-asian-countries-accelerate-hydrogen-plans-with-policies-and-projects))

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Now, whats the point of all this infrastructure? I understand the powerplants but is the future just going to be us driving in Amazon forklifts?* \- Says you, a dumbass who doesnt do DD and leaves it up to others in what is basically a Casino.

Sweet summer child..

Hydrogen fuel is going to be big in the automotive scene. Yes, Papa Musk hates it, so fucking what? keep buying one year out calls @ 50% OTM and tell Musk to fuck off with how much bank you're going to make.

GM may have made a statement that they are going for ALL hydrogen back in 2017, but they have since rescinded that statement. Their Hydrogen plan still remains though, Fuel-cell power-trains will be used in military and commercial vehicles. ([https://twitter.com/mikewayland/status/1283734665157922816?lang=en](https://twitter.com/mikewayland/status/1283734665157922816?lang=en))

Honda is already selling a vehicle with hydrogen fuel cell technology. The Honda Clarity. They plan on expanding on the line greatly as they seem to be extremely set on becoming green.

Hyundai is already selling a vehicle with hydrogen fuel cell technology, the Hyundai Nexo. **Hyundai Motor Group and its suppliers plan to spend of 7.6 trillion won (US$6.7 billion) through 2030 to raise production of fuel cells by more than 200-fold as the South Korean automaker targets to become a key player in the new-energy vehicle technology.**

So much money is flowing into Hydrogen fuel cell technology, why is noone capitalizing on it?

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The play: Wait for volatility to die down, PLUG has had a massive run up. Truly tremendous, and I'm glad to have been in PLUG for a long while. The hype is almost certainly blown up, and general market attitude is that it is a sell which I agree with.

TLDR: PLUG is going to return from low-earth orbit to refuel, my price target is 50 by mid-FEB before PLUG does a Hindenburg and the price fucking explodes. 🚀🚀🚀

&amp;#x200B;

Position:

Wait for good entry: PLUG 70C 06/18. Yes its fucking expensive, wait for better entry and learn how to do spreads, dumbass. You bet big and win big.

If you have more than 6 brain cells or are straight up fucking broke: Buy LEAPS and Shares on the dip thats about to happen. Im in for PLUG 100C 1/20/23, and will load up even more because its as high as Robinhood's shitty platform lets me go. **SPREADS, LEARN HOW TO DO THEM, STOP BEING POOR AND LOSING YOUR TSLA GAINS ON SHITTY PLAYS.**

Have fun playing. Hydrogen is the future."

51,2021-01-20,Kerrisdale Capitol trying to take down $PLUG with unhinged rant that exposes short position,u/repos39,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1fc0j/kerrisdale_capitol_trying_to_take_down_plug_with/,"[https://www.thestreet.com/investing/plug-power-drops-on-kerrisdale-short-positon](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/plug-power-drops-on-kerrisdale-short-positon)

&amp;#x200B;

The best part from this ""takedown"" is:

&gt;Kerrisdale also throws cold water on the partnerships Plug has signed in the past two weeks, ***calling them a sign of weakness rather than strength.***   
&gt;	
&gt;""These 'major' deals should be seen in the context of all the past 'major' deals that never panned out,"" Kerrisdale said.  
🤔

Very reminiscent of the takedown  Spruce Capitol tried on $MGNI a couple weeks ago, now $MGNI is at an all time high. Rants that unveil short positions with colorful language like this seem to be shorts trying to cover their position by depressing the price for a day or so.  I really hate these fuckers.

# RECENT TWEET BY KERRISDALE
&gt; Kerrisdale Capital Tweets 'We're short $PLUG .... We discuss with @grizzlemedia at 1:30.... Plug isn't a way to bet on the overhyped ""hydrogen economy""; ***it's just a /r/wallstreetbets roach motel where your fellow travelers probably failed HS chemistry'***

Like how can you have people who manage money in a professional setting talk like this, and still hold confidence in their decisions?"

Goldman Sachs isn’t yet ready to state the euphoric stock market is one big bubble nearing an epic pop all over the faces of Wall Street bulls, but it is warning investors about some stocks.

“Equity valuations are extremely elevated on an absolute basis. But after taking low interest rates into account, the aggregate index actually trades below average historical valuation,” Goldman’s U.S. equity chief David Kostin says.

Despite Goldman’s research showing that U.S. stocks currently trade at the upper-end of historical metrics for price-to-earnings, price-to-book, enterprise value-to-sales, enterprise value-to-EBITDA and market cap to GDP, Kostin is staying firm on his 2021 S&amp;P 500 price target.

“We expect modestly higher rates will be offset by a declining equity risk premium, leaving the S&amp;P 500 P/E [ratio] effectively unchanged and allowing strong EPS growth to drive the market towards our end target of 4,300,” adds Kostin.

But it’s not all sunshine and rainbows on the Zoom calls with Kostin’s equities strategy team. Kostin’s group of financial modelers is sending a warning to investors in the tech space that continue to blindly trade momentum instead of paying any attention to fundamentals.

“One part of the market that appears frothy and may pose a broader risk is extremely high growth, high multiple stocks,” Kostin says. He singles out stocks with enterprise value-to-sales ratios above 20 times as riddled with froth.

A total of 39 stocks (see below) currently boast such valuation criteria, Goldman found, mostly a litany of tech stocks that seemingly appear daily on Yahoo Finance’s Trending Ticker page. Some notable names called out by Kostin as possibly too pricey includes: Snowflake, c3.ai, Plug Power, Crowdstrike, Cloudflare, Zoom, DataDog, Shopify, DocuSign and Palantir.

Goldman sounds the alarm bell on these 39 hot stocks. 
Goldman sounds the alarm bell on these 39 hot stocks.
Collectively, this list of 39 stocks has gained 6% year-to-date versus a 2% lift on the S&amp;P 500. They sport a trailing-12 month enterprise value-to-sales ratio of 54 times, nearly 15 times the S&amp;P 500 median. On a forward basis, the cohort trades on an enterprise value-to-sales ratio of 29 times, compared to four times for the S&amp;P 500 median.

Kostin stops short of saying these 39 stocks are headed for a crash. Instead, he thinks they could relatively underperform over the next 12 months likely as the financial results of the companies fail to live up to the market hype.

“Since 1985, the median stock trading at an enterprise value-to-sales multiple above 20 times has garnered a subsequent 12-month return of -1%, compared with 6% for the median U.S. stock,” Kostin notes.

I’m getting down right sick of this 2 system country we have. 1 for the poor and 1 for the rich. I know you’re sick of it as much as I am. So what can we do to stop this?   
  
First let’s not forget what happened and push for answers, and push for accountability.   
  
Second let’s keep track of exchanges that are blocking stocks. We know who they are and we need to remember them.

213,2021-02-15,I’ve conducted a little research and found that $PLUG has good growth potential,u/vilnitskiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkorzb/ive_conducted_a_little_research_and_found_that/,"I analyzed some of the PLUG indirect and fundamental metrics and found that the company is in positive dynamics and most likely its stock will grow significantly over the next quarters.  


**1. For more than half a year,** [**https://www.plugpower.com/**](https://www.plugpower.com/) **has been consistently receiving more traffic.  There was a huge jump in traffic in January: +300% compared to previous months.**

https://preview.redd.it/q47xf57ktph61.png?width=842&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d34685120933a718b6117f4ee7c34242cbe4b84

**2. Number of open job positions on Indeed and Glassdoor has increased by \~20% over the past 20 days.**  


https://preview.redd.it/whlcbuuttph61.png?width=837&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0326b5812c64ed03458b44b9b940308da1aabf81

**3. Apart from these indirect metrics, PLUG fundamental metrics are also growing:**

\- Plug Power has been steadily increasing its profits over the past years starting from 2013. The last quarter was a record revenue of $107M

\- In January, Plug signed a contract with Renault to create a joint venture.

\- The company Plug Power itself develops hydrogen fuel cell systems and works in the field of alternative energy, which on its own is quite innovative and lays the ground for further growth of the stock price.

\- **The new administration announced a return to the Paris Climate Accord, which means the inevitable growth of the Alternative Energy market and companies like Plug Power**.   
An interesting overview of the state of the alternative energy market in 2021 - [https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/energy-and-resources/articles/renewable-energy-outlook.html](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/energy-and-resources/articles/renewable-energy-outlook.html)

To sum it up, I may be wrong, but all the indirect and fundamental metrics suggest that Plug Power will cost a lot more in the long run. I will continue monitoring its performance and give you updates here if I find something interesting."

This is why I believe $PLUG has been consolidating and is currently massively undervalued.

**Purchase Orders &amp; Partnerships with Walmart &amp; Amazon**
$PLUG’s largest single customers are currently the retail &amp; e-commerce behemoths, Walmart and Amazon. Both companies utilizing their hydrogen fuel cell packs and refueling stations to power light commercial vehicles in stores/distribution centers (think forklifts and the like for LTC vehicles). These are both huge name customers throwing their weight behind Plug Power with no indication of switching away from their products, but will continue to need more as they respectively, continue to grow.

**SK Group/Renault/Acciona S.A Partnership Announcements**

[SK Group &amp; Plug Power form a strategic partnership to further build out the hydrogen infrastructure in Korea and later the remainder of the Asian markets.](https://www.ir.plugpower.com/Press-Releases/Press-Release-Details/2021/Plug-Power-and-South-Korean-SK-Group-to-Form-a-Strategic-Partnership-to-Accelerate-Hydrogen-Economy-Expansion-in-Asian-Markets-Plug-Power-to-Receive-1.5-Billion-Strategic-Investment-From-SK-Group/default.aspx)

These three major announcements push Plug’s offerings beyond U.S borders opening up revenue from hundreds of millions of potential consumers, both civilian and corporate customers. Clean Hydrogen as a major energy source in SK, hydrogen power LTCV and mass market consumer vehicles with Renault in EU, and reaching Spain’s goal of 100% clean energy in only 9 years by 2030 with Acciona S.A.

**Plug Power Appoints new Chief Marketing Officer from primary competitor, Bloom Energy.**

**Biden-Harris LOVE clean energy**

Its no secret the current administration is funneling a metric fuck load of money toward Green/Clean energy. Including [targeting low-cost hydrogen production within their newly launched Climate Innovation Working Group](https://www.ir.plugpower.com/Press-Releases/Press-Release-Details/2021/Plug-Power-Announces-Preeti-Pande-as-New-Chief-Marketing-Officer/default.aspx). This coupled with the [US Department of Energy’s $100 million in funding to further R&amp;D clean energy initiatives via the Advanced Research Projects Agency- Energy’s (ARPA-E) OPEN 2021 program.](https://www.energy.gov/articles/us-department-energy-announces-100-million-transformative-clean-energy-solutions-supporting).

**Ok, so why did it crash this week?**

“Some fucking country in Europe took a shit [(Norway)](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-u.s.-fuel-cell-stocks-are-crashing-2021-02-17), Let them do what they want to fucking do. Our market’s solid.”
Norway is opening some hydrogen facility to expand their energy dependent economy. All of their exports are oil, now they want to dip their toes in hydrogen. Norway is tiny, and really a non-issue imo. Their primary focus is still oil, natural gas, and fish lmao. Long term this could be good as the region becomes more accepting of hydrogen and Plug Power, as the current clear leader in the space, can wiggle in for a piece of the pie. $BE &amp; $FCEL are also sliding down, though this appears to be slowing down, primed for a sharp reversal.

TL;DR: Hydrogen is a key part of the global transition to green/clean energy. Will it outshine EV/ICE cars? Fuck no, but it doesn’t need to make a metric fuck ton of money. $PLUG is the clear leader in the hydrogen space, and their lead will continue to grow.

Disclosure: This is not financial advice. This is my DD that I am choosing to share to simply spark a conversation and share my own personal thoughts for others to poke a hole in in case I overlook something. I am long $PLUG via 1k shares and given today’s market slide, should it continue, I’ll be converting some of my holdings to LEAPS dating Jan 2023.

(Clean Energy) THE FUTURE OF ENERGY 💡",u/marquez_lbc,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmbb2x/fcel_plug_be_clean_energy_the_future_of_energy/,"I’ve seen a lot of people bash on the green energy sector the last few market days because of steep drops and it’s just fucking silly. 

You have to also consider that, for example, even though FCEL is down roughly 18% in the last week of trading it’s up 32% + over the last month. 

You also have to consider that this is a sector that is currently being supercharged around the world and one that has sooooo much growth and innovation ahead of it now that it’s the mainstream focus both in the USA and abroad. So anyone who’s scared and says there’s no future for hydrogen fuel cell, or nuclear energy, or any other type of renewable/green energy is talking out of their ass. 

It stands to reason that major “entities” in our media want to stoke fear into people so that they sell and the stock drops allowing those same major “entities to buy in more towards the bottom. 

I may be completely wrong about what’s behind the drops and criticism in the sector but I’m not wrong that renewable stocks are the way to a big bank and a better climate future. It’s a win-win. 

I’ve also read a lot of articles, particularly right-leaning, that are attempting to lay the blame for the power outages in Texas on green energy. That’s just fucking absurd too Texas runs 88% on non-renewable energy. So fuck them. 

Don’t be scared to buy into a greener future, both in terms of your finances and the environment.

UPDATE: Plug reached a low of 33 before climbing back to 39+ Congrats if you got in and best of luck. Please be reminded their financial statements are still pending and may take a while. 

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/plug-power-restate-previously-issued-210000037.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/plug-power-restate-previously-issued-210000037.html)

PLUG power down hard after hours due to news that there are some small accounting errors. I believe this is a great buy in and been meaning to release some DD on it that it is a very underrated stock. Why? They're a legit company and the better of the fuel cell stocks (FCEL for example) with contracts in Europe and Korea.

\- Korea recently invested in them at **30$ a share**. Should be a floor.

\- Energy pull back recent weeks. This is easily a 100$ stock by next year

\- Legit company, not like Nikola. Their glassdoor even has a hiring *SURGE*:

[https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Plug-Power-Reviews-E9782.htm](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Plug-Power-Reviews-E9782.htm)

\- CEO statement on this:

Andy Marsh, CEO of Plug Power, said, “Since our founding nearly 25 years ago, Plug Power has prided itself on operating ***with transparency and integrity, and we are working to resolve this matter quickly. Importantly, there is no expected impact to our cash position, business operations or economics of commercial arrangements***. We continue to execute on our mission to provide customers with state-of-the-art fuel cell and green hydrogen solutions. We remain confident in our ability to leverage our strong business momentum and market leading technologies, independently and alongside our joint venture partners, to capture the significant business opportunities in this rapidly growing industry.

Positions (Swing):

I only wish I didn’t hesitate at 35 for the swing.

Keep in mind several banks have high price targets for PLUG. The bearish case of this is if they lower their targets tomorrow. I’d be shocked"

If you're thinking of buying shares or calls, don't. If you hold shares or calls, sell them. If you want to make a bet, buy puts.**

It's July 2000. You've made a decent amount of tendies over the past few years investing in hot tech companies. The markets are down a fair bit from their March highs, but that just means there are more buying opportunities. Maybe you can find the next Microsoft.

You find a stock that looks promising -- Plug Power. It's down 50% from its 52-week high, but you're sure it's gonna be huge. Green energy is the future. It's got the largest company in the world, General Electric, as an investor. [Bob Nardelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Nardelli), the head of GE Power Systems and a contender to succeed Jack Welch, is on the board of directors. And their joint venture with GE just announced a deal to sell 1500 fuel cells to a Saudi Arabian trading company controlled by the royal family. If even the oil kingdom is moving to the hydrogen economy, you want to be a part of it. You're buying.

Over the next few years, you will lose more than 95% of your investment.

What happened? Well, there is public documentation on some of this: the Saudi trading company sued Plug and the GE subsidiary that co-owned the joint venture in 2008 for breach of contract and misrepresentation. You can find a summary of the complaint [here](https://casetext.com/case/soroof-trading-development-company-ltd-plaintiff-v-ge-microgen-inc-and-plug-power-inc-defendants), but I'm working from a copy of their First Amended Complaint.

The complaint alleges that GE and Plug ""understood by February 1999 that [Plug's fuel cells] would never be marketable"" but formed the joint venture (GE Fuel Cell Systems, which I'll call either GEFCS or just ""the JV"" for short) anyway to try and recoup costs. Soroof (the name of the Saudi trading company, but I'll call them ""the guys who financed 9/11"" for long) further alleges that GEFCS was just an empty shell with ""nominal assets consisting of a small amount of furniture, a telephone switch and a computer server"" and an office subleased from Plug. And GEFCS duly extracted $1 million from the guys who financed 9/11 in exchange for exclusive rights to distribute the fuel cells in Saudi Arabia.

Somewhat incredibly, the complaint alleges that Plug and GE then proceeded to jerk around the guys who financed 9/11 for *five years*, telling Soroof over and over again that they were improving the product and it wasn't quite ready yet but it would be soon. Finally, ""In 2005, Soroof expressed its dissatisfaction with [GE and Plug's] complete lack of performance to date"", which you might recognize as the same thing your wife did right before she introduced you to Chad. The JV had effectively been dead for years (or so Soroof claims), but GE and Plug knew to expect a lawsuit, and hurriedly wound up the operation, with PLUG indemnifying GE against the first $1 million in claims arising from GEFCS. Plug [filed an 8-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000119312506063079/d8k.htm) notifying the markets of the termination of the JV, but they didn't tell the Saudis. And when the Saudis found out in early 2007, they completely lost their shit, and they sure did sue. (As best as I can tell the lawsuit ended up dissolving in a flurry of procedural arguments. I'm not a lawyer and I don't care.)

So if this complaint was filed by the guys who financed 9/11, why should you believe them? Well, there are other signs that the higher-ups at GE knew pretty quickly that Plug's fuel cells weren't going to be commercially viable. GE had agreed to buy fuel cells from Plug in early 1999 -- but they [couldn't meet specifications](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB957739751789506989) and cancelled the entire contract in spring 2000. Bob Nardelli was [off the board by mid-July 2000](https://eepower.com/news/john-g-rice-assumes-position-on-plug-powers-board-of-directors/), and it's telling that neither his [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobnardelli/) nor [his successor's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-rice-30b651118/?originalSubdomain=hk) nor the [president of the JV](https://biography.omicsonline.org/france/technip/barry-glickman-36852) makes reference to their involvement with Plug or GEFCS. And this also sounds like the MO of General Electric circa 2000, which was, in hindsight, [a bag of shit trading at 50 times earnings](https://philo.substack.com/p/success-theater) propped up by expansion into questionable businesses like long-term care insurance and a whole bunch of accounting gimmicks. That stock is also down more than 80% from its October 2000 high, although at least you got paid a dividend for your trouble.

But the biggest reason GE should have known early that Plug's fuel cells wouldn't be marketable is basic physics. To get green hydrogen, you need to consume electricity to separate water into hydrogen and oxygen (losing some along the way). Then you need to consume more energy to compress and transport the hydrogen. Then you turn it back into water, electricity and waste heat in a fuel cell. It's much cheaper and more efficient to transmit the energy directly over high-voltage power lines! For some applications -- like the forklifts that Plug promotes today -- there is a last-mile problem to solve, but as I'm sure you've heard, battery technology today is very good, and it's just more economical to use battery power. (I'll have more to say about both the physics and the forklifts in follow-on posts.)

Through the fiscal years 2001-6, Plug Power produced a cumulative loss of $16 million on $67 million of revenue *before any operating expenses*. Their net loss was much worse. By early 2007, the stock was trading at about where it is today on a split-adjusted basis, and if you bought in July 2000 you were down 95%. It got cut by another 90% before it rallied last year. And today looks a lot like July of 2000: Plug is [partnering with big oil companies](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/fossil-fuel-mainstay-baker-hughes-joins-plug-power-in-green-hydrogen-fund-11617629145) and [taking sovereign investment money](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921001786/tm211407d2_8k.htm). More worryingly, it's delinquent filing its 10-K for 2020 and is [restating its accounts](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-to-restate-financial-statements-stock-plunges-11615930211) for the last two years, and it posted a [negative gross profit in Q3 2020](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837020013381/plug-20200930x10q.htm). Learn from the mistakes of the past. Sell the dip in PLUG.

272,2021-04-15,PLUG is incredibly oversold and way under current stock valuation... And why it's going up at least 100%.,u/718cs,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mrpky1/plug_is_incredibly_oversold_and_way_under_current/,"PLUG is down over 60% from it's ATH. The renewable energy market was overbought and PLUG needed a pullback, similar to TSLA/NIO/FCEL/etc.

Bad News:

It got hit with an accounting error because of their auditors, KPMG. PLUG (mainly KPMG) has to reinstate it's financial results from 2018 to 2020. This caused investors to lose trust and tumble the stock into way oversold territory. Most analysts summarized the accounting issues to appear as minor but short-term worrisome, and there's limited near-term upside until resolution. This issue was 1 month ago when PLUG was trading around $48. It's nearly fallen by 50% since then.

Multiple law firms, primarily lead by ""Gross Law Firm"", also announced a class action lawsuit against PLUG. Causing it to drop ~10% more. Looking into Gross Law Firm, that's their entire business model, suing companies on behalf of shareholders on stocks that aren't performing well enough. In April alone they have opened up 9 new lawsuits against varies companies. Records show that most are settled out of court or completely dropped. In 2018 Gross Law Firm also opened a class action lawsuit against Tesla and look where TSLA is now.

Good News:

Wall Street already grossly underestimates the hydrogen energy sector. Currently Wall Street is valuing Hydrogen Energy to be roughly 1% of the world's energy. But forecasts show by 2025 it'll be between 5-12%. PLUG is the leading green energy hydrogen company. The O&amp;G industry has reduced lobbying against Hydrogen Energy and is joining the sector: Chevron and Shell joined the Hydrogen Energy Council last year, and Exxon this year. The transition to Hydrogen Energy is starting to explode.

Last week PLUG was invited by the US department of defense to apply for a new $520 million loan guarantee. This news was still overshadowed by the accounting errors and hasn't reacted fully from it.  Upcoming news from the Biden administration will show they are ready, willing and able to provide strong support for hydrogen projects, increasing the valuating of PLUG.

Upon receiving approval from the DoE, PLUG will utilize its electrolyzer, liquefaction and distribution technologies to deploy the first resilient network of zero-carbon hydrogen production facilities across the United States. The facilities will have a combined liquid hydrogen generation capacity of approximately 180 tons per day. 

Let's review their balance sheet. PLUG also has over 1.3B of cash on hand. 1.6B in current assets and 800M in other assets. It has roughly ONLY 236M in current liabilities giving PLUG a huge advantage to invest in future energy projects mentioned above. OR settle any accounting issues, fines, or lawsuits. BABA (45x larger company) settled a $2.4B fine and the shares JUMPED 9% because investors were no longer worried, uncertainty was behind them. When PLUG reinstates it's accounting issues the stock WILL jump. Also, PLUG's 2021 financial reports have no errors and do not need to be reinstated. This is a problem in their past they need to solve.

PLUG also already has major contract supply deals with many top companies, including Amazon and Walmart, which are also current investors of PLUG. PLUG is working with Walmart to provide it with fuel cell-powered vehicles. There are plans for expansion of this deal sometime in 2021.

Looking at current analyst's price targets, 69% (ayyy) of analyst say BUY, only 1 (6%) says to SELL. The LOWEST price target for PLUG is $29, nearly $3 lower than today's close. The HIGHEST is $78, just a few dollars short of its 52-week high. Average is $57, which is 115% upside. Read this again... the lowest... price target... on PLUG... is $29. That is HIGHER than its current stock price.

For those who care about TA, even with over a 500% 1Y gain on PLUG, PLUG has just reached oversold territory based on a RSI of 30. For shorter term traders: the 4h and 1h are also hovering around 30. The Stochastic lines have crossed in every time measure, and it's entering an uptrend off the lows of today. Even if you don't believe PLUG long term, there's potential for a quick gain as this flies back to its support of $28-32 in the week or two.

TL;DR: PLUG is grossly oversold and will bounce back to around $30 in a couple weeks. Good news is being overshadowed by an accounting error and when that problem is settled, PLUG will fly. Average price target is $58, but my price target is $75 by EoY. Based on cash flow, Biden administration push for renewable energy, clean energy sector growing, and PLUG's plan for Hydrogen production facilities and vehicle research/production, PLUG can easily hit that $75 price sooner.

Positions: I've already purchased 60k in $25 and $30 strike calls expiring 1/2023. I plan to increase that by another 40k soon. If PLUG hits the average analyst price target by January of next year, I'll close my position when it crosses $500,000 value."

Maybe it is my Catholic upbringing (didn’t take) that wants me to do the walk of shame (aka penance in Catholicism).  I’m feeling guilt after my posts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m7ggs3/cramer_on_plug_powers_stock_drop_i_still_longterm/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mmuvqh/plug_to_get_a_520_million_loan_guarantee_to_build/).  I bailed big time!  I feel bad if anybody bought $PLUG off my posts – though I understand I’m not the only beat-up bull on this stock.  And I’ll mention I did buy the January 25 ‘22 calls when plug was hovering around $29 – I’ll do another walk of shame in January or before if that doesn’t work out.  But I’ll understand if I’m not on some people’s Christmas Card list!

You might notice from my posts I’m a Cramer minion – have been for many a year.  That may not score me a lot of karma points here, but all I can say is he has worked for me.  I wouldn’t say I’m rich, but feel comfortable in retirement.  He just might have been at least one person responsible for that (sorry if that offends anybody).  With the Cramer video I posted he said he ‘liked the stock long-term’.  In Cramer-speak I knew, I knew I could get killed in the short-term – I got killed.  However he has drilled into me over the years: “**Diversification is the only free lunch in the stock market”**.  That has saved me, I’m not dead meat in retirement – just a bit annoyed.  And I’m more annoyed at plug CEO Andy Marsh.  I wish he would hit the airwaves and reassure us buckaroos out here the accounting error(s) are no big deal – over and over again would be nice.

There!  My Our Lady of Perpetual Guilt post.

117,2021-05-01,Cohu; the plug for your favorite semiconductor companies,u/Radish-Perfect,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n2ojmq/cohu_the_plug_for_your_favorite_semiconductor/,"What if I told you that Qualcomm, Intel, Skyworks, Texas Instruments, Samsung, and Analog devices all had something in common in their supply chain? They all buy their testing capital equipment from Cohu. 

Cohu offers a few different products. All of them are within the market of testing computer chips. Why is this market important? Well on the customer end, imagine if you spent 2500$ on a laptop and the intel chip inside didn't work. You'd return it to BestBuy, who would return it to HP, who would return it to Intel. A long and expensive chain of returns for a nonfunctional product. This issue can also be more than just an inconvenience. What if you bought a self driving tesla and one of the chips in the sensors didn't work? What if a Boeing airbus had some faulty chips in the navigation system? In short, it's very important that the semi manufacturers know that their product is working when they send it out. 

**Bullish trends**

1. Semiconductor volume is increasing in the following industries, **mobile phones** (5g needs 2x the chips), **Computing**, **Automotive** (electric and self driving need exponentially more chips than cars of the past), **Cloud computing** (basically a warehouse of semiconductors) **AI** (not sure how this works, but it's going to need computer chips). Here's my main argument: ***Each of those markets is rapidly growing, and at the same time chip volume is rising in each of those markets***. This creates a sort of exponential effect for the semiconductor chain. Not only is there a strong catalyst from increasing volume in existing markets (phones, pcs), but we also see rapidly growing new markets that also have high density. (cloud, auto). This is very bullish for the entire semi supply chain.  But the key feature that benefits testing in particular, is increasing complexity of chips. A more complex chip requires more complex testing, which demands a higher premium. 
2. Semiconductor shortage. We all know demand for computer chips is very high. And supply has just about run out. This means that prices for semiconductors should increase due to scarcity. This is great news for Cohu, as it leaves more margin to charge for testing. If you were ford would you pay a premium on chips in order to produce your vehicles?
3. Increasing chip complexity, on smaller wafers, demands a higher price for testing. AMAT recently noted on April 6th analyst day that capital intensity (% revenue spent on capital equipment) is returning to the 2000 highs of 16%. This increased capital intensity seems especially true when we consider the global chip shortage. Intel and Tsm are opening new fabs in the last couple months. These factories are going to require a shit-ton of capital equipment. For example TSMC announced they'll be spending $100 billion over the next 3 years on capital equipment, as their fabs have been running at 100% for months and still can't keep up with demand.
4. Trend of strong growth. Cohu has shown strong growth in the last year. In Q1 2020, revenue was $138.9 million, and gross margin was 41.7%. Q1 2021 revenue was just reported at $225.1 million, and gross margin was 45.6%. This is annual revenue growth of 62%, and margin growth of 9%. Business outlook in only getting better as the semiconductor shortage worsens, and demand continues to grow across sectors.
5. Very high accounts receivable. Accounts receivable is up 30% annually to 197 million$. Recurring customers represent 48% of Cohu's revenue, so this is a very strong sign in my opinion. 

**Bearish trends**

1. The company is on a huge downturn in the last few trading days due to announcing 42-45% gross margin for Q2 instead of 45%+, like Q1. This is on increased revenue of 234-250 million forecasted for Q2. A decrease in GM on growing revenue is never a great sign. The reason for this change is that much of the forecasted growth is in the automotive segment, which is lower margin than other segments I mentioned in the last section. Essentially the chips in cars aren't as complicated as the chips in PCs or phones, so they are less expensive, and therefore have a lower margin for testing. I will point out that the firm is likely to generate more gross margin dollars next quarter than this quarter, albeit on lower gm %. (.43x240=$103.2 gm, vs this last quarter 225x.456=$102.6gm). 
2. Recent stock offering. Cohu sold 4,950,000 shares at 41$ at the start of march. This diluted the shares available, but raised $202 million for the firm. They used this to pay off debt, and fund future growth. 
3. strong competition. Cohu's main competitors are advantest, and teradyne. These are two large global firms that have significantly more financial resources than Cohu. Cohu does have some advantages over these strong competitors, it's the global leader in Radio frequency power amplifier. RF amplifiers are a key component in mobile phones, and are increasing in volume with the 5g rollout. (more chips per phone, and more complexity) Essentially Cohu is in the dominant position in this growing market. Cohu is also the leader in automotive handling. (handling is a process where chips are moved into the testing device, then sorted based on results).

**Fundamental analysis**

I use a ratio similar to p/e. I use gross margin/market cap. (If I was buying the whole company, I'd want to know how much profit I'm purchasing).

Cohu annual gm=$316,000,000. Cohu market cap=$1,925,000,000

$316 million/$1925 million=6.09

This is a very attractive price/gm ratio. Lets compare it to some other companies ratios. 

Cohu-6.09

aapl-19.12

amzn-18

ter-11.3

advantest-7.19

swks-17.9

If cohu were trading at the same multiplier as it's large cap competitor, Teradyne, the stock price would nearly double.

Taking a look at the balance sheet, Cohu is in a much better position today than 1 year ago. They have $290 million of cash, almost double from a year ago. They also have significantly lower long term debt. \~$200 million today versus \~$300 million a year ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Technical analysis**

[Cohu 1 year chart](https://preview.redd.it/pav84wurgjw61.png?width=1504&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d65ce5a266334b6f1c8a9cd3fb344509441451e)

As we can see from the 1 year chart above, Cohu seems to find support around the $40 mark for the past 6 months. Currently it's chillin out on the support line, so this indicates to me that it's a good time to purchase cohu, as I love buying dips. We can also see it's found resistance at around $50, having tested that line 3-4 times since the start of the year. I cannot say with certainty that it will break this resistance line, but I do expect it to at least check this number again some time in the next 2-3 months. My expected range for this stock in the next 3 months is between $50 and $65, which leaves room for some nice profit if one were to buy at $40. 

In conclusion, cohu is a small cap in an extremely hot market. It's got some big competitors, but it holds certain key advantages over them. The financial position of the company is really good currently, and it's growth should continue for the foreseeable future. It's strongest catalyst is that semiconductor density is increasing in existing markets, and new markets are emerging with high density, which has the potential to create enormous growth. For this reason, I think COHU is a great choice. (Even if you disagree on Cohu, you will want to have some semiconductors in your portfolio for the next few years). 

Disclaimer: I'm holding call options on this company.

The lawsuit filed against Plug Power by the Klein Law Firm alleges that:

""\[T\]he company would be unable to timely file its 2020 annual report due to delays related to the review of classification of certain costs and the recoverability of the right to use assets with certain leases. The company was reasonably likely to report material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting and as a result of the

foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about the company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.""

The lawsuit was filed on behalf of shareholders who purchased shares between Nov. 9, 2020, and Mar. 1, 2021.

Price Action: Plug Power traded as high as $75.49 and as low as $3.79 over a 52-week period. The stock was down 6.95% at $24.78 at last check Tuesday."

38,2021-05-07,PLUG: The Cash Shredder,u/fermatprime,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/,"**tl;dr: PLUG uses its shareholders' hard-earned cash to fund a money-losing business which may never be economical, with big profits for mega-cap retailers along the way.**

It's me, the [butt plug gay bear](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) from a few weeks ago. Remember when PLUG was over 30 bucks a share? Good times, I could get the June $20 puts for like 50 cents. Not anymore!

I want to talk to you today about how PLUG makes its money. The usual way to answer this question is by reading the latest 10-K -- but PLUG still hasn't filed a 10-K for 2020 despite being [10 days](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921038399/tm219753d3_8k.htm) from losing compliance with NASDAQ listing rules and risking being de-listed. This would be bad for the stock.

The 10-K (people in the industry* call it just a ""K"" for short) is pretty long and boring anyway, but luckily the SEC makes companies file financial statements every quarter, so we can look at [the Q](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837020013381/plug-20200930x10q.htm) to see what PLUG was doing during the first 9 months of 2020.

Take a look at the Statement of Cash Flows on page 7. The first column of numbers indicates how much money PLUG got or made from doing stuff over those 9 months, with regular numbers meaning they made money and numbers in (parentheses) meaning they used money. In the course of doing business stuff, PLUG burned an astonishing amount of cash -- something like $182 million, which I get by adding the ""net cash used in operating activities"" line to the ""purchases of property, plant and equipment"" and ""purchases for construction of leased property"" lines. They also spent another $40 million on acquisitions. All that money has to come from somewhere. But if it's not coming from business activities, then where?

Look no further than the ""net cash provided by financing activities"" line -- a robust $590 million. More than half of that is from ""proceeds from public offerings, net of transaction costs"" -- selling stock. How does Plug Power make its money? By selling stock (and issuing convertible debt).

If you go back and look at the [2019 K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837020002267/plug-20191231x10k.htm) -- sorry, I know it's long -- they will tell you outright that this is the only way they've ever made money: ""We have not achieved operating profitability in any quarter since our formation."" They've lost $1.4 billion in their lifetime as a public company, according to the Q. But they think they're on the right track: ""In order to achieve profitability, we must successfully execute our planned path to profitability in the early adoption markets on which we are focused."" 

So let's talk just a bit about those early adoption markets. If you know anything about PLUG, you likely know that they sell hydrogen fuel cell systems (the brand name is ""GenKey"") to Amazon and Walmart for use in forklifts. But you might not know why Amazon and Walmart might be interested in such a thing. This is -- I apologize -- another bit where you have to read a bit more. If you go back to the latest Q and read Note 12, you will see that Amazon and Walmart got warrants -- effectively, call options with a strike price a bit over $1, so effectively shares right now -- to buy these fuel cells from PLUG. Amazon has paid PLUG $200M and gotten 30 million shares in return (currently worth north of $600M) -- whenever the stock was over $8 from 2017 to late 2020, Amazon could turn a profit by buying stuff from PLUG and immediately trashing it. (That breakeven point for AMZN is now considerably higher, at about $33.) Walmart has paid something like $50 million for 13 million shares, also a nice profit. (Their breakeven is still at $8 -- what does it say about PLUG's products that Walmart isn't buying more of them?)

Where is this money that Amazon and Walmart is making coming from, by the way? Well, it's coming from the people they sell the stock to -- but more broadly it's coming from PLUG shareholders as a group, because the supply of PLUG stock is expanding. 

PLUG is probably not going to de-list from the NASDAQ. They need to raise money from the equity markets to survive, and they can do that much more easily and efficiently on a big exchange than they could on the pink sheets. But they're going to have to restate their accounts from the last few years because of these warrants -- and it's not clear that they'll be able to make such a deal again. If you want to support the transition to clean energy, find a nice cobalt miner or battery company or something; don't try and catch this falling knife.

*Despite [some guesses in the comments of my last post](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/gu03v8s/) investing's just my hobby. But I don't want to fault /u/nastysnacks' deductive powers; they correctly concluded that I'm betting against PLUG, maybe on the evidence of my stated position."

Plug Power finally removed the overhang of uncertainty after restatement and as I expected there was no misconduct or abuse of internal controls. Plug reached all-time high of 73.18$ in January 26 but unfortunately they reported some issue in their cash value that called for restatement.

On May 10 it reached the low of 20.07$ and now this week the restatement was completed and it actually showed increased in revenue for the Q1. 

I am bullish about Plug Power despite Cramer trying to put it down simply because he didn’t like that Plug had to do restatement 🤦🏽‍♂️. Anyway, share your thoughts on comments. What do you think?"

34,2021-05-25,The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out,u/fermatprime,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nkh20n/the_plug_restatement_a_great_chance_to_get_out/,"**tl;dr: PLUG has rallied on relief from the completion of its restatement, but accounting red flags remain -- and the economics are as bad as ever.**

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&amp;D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

&gt; On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead."

(PLUG) has received a beating on their stock price the last few months, due to being unable to deliver their Q1 financials on time for NASDAQ requirements. They also revised their 10-K 2020, and their finals showed a very significant decrease in net profit margin YoY. However, they've raised a pretty amazing 1.1bn in cash, and they're continuing to take over market share: they spent 400m in 2020 on M&amp;A. They're going to report their Q1 earnings on 10 July 2021, I believe they're going to absolutely crush earnings, the insane amount of cash they had on hand has been showing in the new ventures &amp; partnerships they're getting. They focus heavily on the fact that they're not going to generate any (strong) positive net revenue in the next few years, but as long as they keep taking market share and expanding this strong I'm bullish af.

Position: 10 Vertical Call Spreads 17SEP21\_35 (long) &amp; 17SEP21\_40 (short) and some more long dated calls.

On the TA side (fig): anchored VWAP shows a convergence to the 100 SMA. We just crossed 200 SMA, and still trading at such a discount. RSI and MACD look really healthy, if volume picks up I think we can see some really big moves (the PLUG power we know and love).

If you haven't, check out my previous posts, in which I discuss [PLUG's past](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/), [PLUG's financials](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), and [PLUG's accounting restatement](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nkh20n/the_plug_restatement_a_great_chance_to_get_out/).

FCEL was down 10% today on declining revenue, and pulled PLUG down with it to some extent. But before you get too excited about buying the dip, you should keep in mind that PLUG [has until Monday](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm) to file its quarterly financial statements with the SEC or risk being delisted from the NASDAQ. This is the second consecutive quarter that PLUG has been extremely tardy to file; that is a pretty major red flag.

I don't know when PLUG will report earnings, or what the numbers will be like (they will almost certainly have a net loss and negative operating cash flow). They probably won't get delisted even if they miss Monday's deadline; NASDAQ's made good money from trading in this stock over the last year. But management has raised gobs of cash selling this stock for the company, and insiders have [lined their own pockets](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/plug/insider-activity) selling 13 million shares, many at prices much lower than today's. Do you know enough about this company to want to be on the other side of that trade? If not, consider getting out before the music stops.

Positions: Puts so I'm unsqueezable."

Plug Power Plugging Away at Improving Hydrogen Energy,u/PennyStocksoftheDay,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o23dge/plug_plug_power_plugging_away_at_improving/,"Green energy investing is all the rage these days. Indeed, there are many reasons for investors to be bullish on this space.

Beside the obvious demand shift that is underway, green energy stocks have received extra attention of late in the political arena. Everything from hydro to wind and solar power are now in the purview of governments around the world.

However, one green energy sector that’s been waiting in the wings for quite a while for a boost has been the hydrogen sector. It’s a sector that’s been around for decades, but has seemingly always lacked that one catalyst that could take it over the edge.             - President Biden’s recent infrastructure spending bills seek to change that. The Biden Administration has promised increased funding to various hydrogen-related projects on the horizon. Although the details remain murky, investors seem to like Plug Power (PLUG) as a key beneficiary (directly or indirectly) of this spending.

Let’s take a look at what sort of upside may be on the horizon for PLUG stock in this bullish environment for hydrogen plays today..📈🚀📈.   Let’s go to the moonn"

They have all been doing well, and I expect they all have huge potential as we slowly transition to a greener future.

Plug power is a hydrogen fuel cell company with great potential for clean energy. They have also been doing well financially with the stock price going from $5 to $60 in the time I’ve had shares. Currently at $30ish.

Workhorse is an electric vehicle company. I think they are well placed to take a section of the future of the market.

Sunrun is a solar power producer. 

Vestas wind systems is a huge wind power company. Based in Copenhagen, VWDRY is their American arm.

Hope some of you all choose to invest in these green companies. Do good for the planet and make some money while you’re at it!"

60,2021-10-13,Upcoming $PLUG Catalysts,u/After_Ad3590,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q7e98w/upcoming_plug_catalysts/,"First of all, PLUG popped today (it's currently up 10%), so I would possibly wait until Friday, when things have cooled off, to jump in (unless you wanna gamble and get in before the symposium tomorrow in case they release some big news like revenue predictions, expansion, or a partnership). This is more of a 2 month play I'd say.

\- Morgan Stanley upgraded Plug today saying it's ""well positioned to be a leader in the hydrogen economy"" and increased their price target from $35 to $40. Of 25 analyst recommendations, 17 are buy, 1 outperform, and 7 hold (0 sell recommendations currently). The median price target is $40.

\- Symposium tomorrow: Microsoft's Mark Monroe, Principle Engineer will speak, Australian billionaire Andrew ""Twiggy"" forest will speak, Senator CHUCK SCHUMER will attend this event, and has ties with the company (Plug previously hosted Chuck at the Green Hydrogen Plant in New York). They will also unveil ""its \[hydrogen\] van developed in partnership with Renault"" (a French automaker).

\- Partnerships: PLUG has just partnered with Airbus and Phillips 66. Last week they formed a joint venture with  **SOUTH KOREA’S SK E&amp;S** to expand into Asia (they also plan to expand into Germany). The CEO, Andy Marsh, was also on Mad Money on Monday and ""said that Plug is cooperating with General Motors on materials handling"".

\-Infrastructure bill set to pass no later than October 31st (9.5 billion allocated toward ""clean hydrogen"" research, thus legitimizing and investing in PLUG's sector)

\-Q3 earnings coming out November 7th

\-UN Climate Change conference beginning at the end of October

IMO, PLUG Power is set to capitalize on the ""green movement"" and innovation directed toward fighting climate change. My positions are 2 10/15 $29 calls and 5 10/22 $30 as I don't have a lot of money; HOWEVER, I plan to take profit this week and, once there is a pullback, buy options in late November/early December between $35 and $38. Like I mentioned above, unless you wanna risk the possible catalyst (tomorrow's symposium) pumping it further, wait for a pullback then jump in. This stock just might fly these next few months."

I just went over their earnings and it doesn't look great. It also seems like the company is burning cash like crazy on (imo) less than wise ventures. Biggest reason being the COVID pandemic stressing the workforce and supply lines, and acquiring company's right now is risky af. 
After a deep dive into their company it appears they are struggling a little bit. 
Job postings over 10 months old for production workers. 
Equally as long for management and engineering..
Wages are lower than desired for most according to Glassdoor and what not.
There are things I get, like the push for green energy, but why Plug? Suddenly a company that has failed to be profitable its entire career has investor attention? 
This stinks of manipulation to me.. I am curious though of sentiment among you dingus's.."

Plug announced multiple partnerships and aqusitions this last Nov-Dec leading into the Nasdaq correction. Bringing the stock price down close to 50% like most growth stocks. $46 down to $25 now.  Plug projects over 1 billion in sale in the next 1-2 years. 

Buying Frames group opens India to hydrogen, partnerships with companies In Europe open hydrogen shipping and transport as well 50-50 partnership with Renault to make hydrogen light commercial vans and cars. (Think Amazon fedex style van, Amazon already a customer for hydrogen forklifts) 

Other pillar customers are Walmart and Home Depot 

This company is sitting on a pile of cash like a money hungrey dragon only spending it on buying small companies for vertical integration and over compensating its CEO.  The state of New York has a hard on for this company and keeps dumping cash at it. Chuck Schumer is at all of their big press releases 

These guys make the hydrogen, get paid to ship it, make the fuel cells to run on the hydrogen and now are partners with Renault to make a car to put the fue cell in. Think back up generators for data centers at Microsoft and Amazon, google. People are going to need this shit and Plug makes green shit that people love.

371,2022-03-05,Coca cola's missing cocaine- who is america's plug?,u/bannannamo,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t7mdfl/coca_colas_missing_cocaine_who_is_americas_plug/,"Coca cola imports around 100 metric tonnes of coca leaf every year to Stepan company, where it gets extracted into an alkaloid slurry (a black tarry mix of cocaine alkyloids and others). That gets sent to Mallinckrodt where cocaine is extracted to a tune of 1% gross yield from leaf. that's of 500-1000 kilos of cocaine. Coca cola makes up most of the coca imports into USA, and its supply chain is grandfathered in as the only one able to process coca material. 

This is really about drugs, but I'm going to start with Mallinckrodt which is the most shifty character in this supply chain.

The main medicine they produce with cocaine is acthar gel, which is worth $800,000/L for a gross profit of $350MM yearly. that's only accounting for at most 50 liters of gel form cocaine, or about 50 kg if it were made of pure cocaine (it's not but for this I'm assuming some loss). 

but then it goes to the medical supply market in raw form. for the AMAZING fucking price of $25/oz (page 33 of ""Pharmacology and Abuse of Cocaine, Amphetamines, Ecstasy and Related Designer Drugs"") so it aint worth shit. The demand for medical cocaine HCL in the usa for 2018? 29 KG. 

Surely they can't be backdooring cocaine out of a publicly listed company?

And then when they finally did get caught with oxycodone: 

[https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/crippled-by-opioid-crisis-litigation-mallinckrodt-settlement-brings-company-closer-to](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/crippled-by-opioid-crisis-litigation-mallinckrodt-settlement-brings-company-closer-to)

Which ultimately bankrupted them. So why did the stock never delist? It looks like they held it together just enough to make it all the way out of bankruptcy. So now we have a medical giant with a market cap of $9.2MM emerging from bankruptcy. And they're propped up by black market sales of most of their most addictive drugs. 

Which includes fentanyl- which is why I could never suggest to buy this horrendously undervalued company, but by financials and fundamentals the company is worth more than 9 million in assets right now- by about 51 million on acthar's patent alone. These guys are likely providing sketchy buyers drugs that are killing Americans. 

so why did this easy target not get shorted into the dirt? unable to borrow and unable to pay its debt, no money to buy shares back. It should have gone down as unsuccessful, with patents sold at auction. Why did no other corp acquire it? There's no reason why they'll stay at 0.12 per share- this is a company that was well over 1.2 billion market cap before bankruptcy with shares around $50.

The answer I believe lies in 420-920 missing kilos of 99.9% pure cocaine HCL every year. Here's where it's for sale:

Hear me out...,u/CallieCallie86,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wka3y7/picking_up_plug_calls_for_tonights_earnings_hear/,"There's a rating done by the Investor's Business Daily called the [""Relative Strength"" or ""RS""](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) which identifies market leadership with a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score. The grade shows how a stock's price movement over the trailing 52 weeks compares to all the other stocks in their database. Plug Power (PLUG) saw an improvement to its Relative Strength (RS) Rating on Monday, with an increase from 72 to 89. This means investors have a very positive outlook on the stock moving forward, which will be demonstrated by an extremely positive earnings report tonight. 

Over 100 years of market history shows that the best-performing stocks tend to have an RS Rating of over 80 as they begin their biggest price moves.

Earnings growth dropped last quarter - but revenue gains moved higher, from 34% to 96%.

Anyways, PLUG 8/12 25c for only 1.22 a pop is the name of the game here."

1. Although it might be a good investment on the long run (like for 1 or 2 years until they built their Hydrogen Plants and got them running) it currently looks more like traders are using the volatility to make some money midterm. The Company didn't make any profit yet and the negative EPS was always under the expectations, which have been reduced during the last 4 quarters. 

The announced Walmart Deal in April 2022 gave it a little bounce up, though the stock price dropped shortly after the announcement and kept dropping down to 13$ on Mai 12th where it hit a support line at an RSI of 25. 

2. After hitting a resistance Line on August 15th at 29.9$ and an RSI of 75 it pivoted and dropped more than 10% within the next 3 days. Traders probably started taking profit here from the previous rally?  
PSAR also has been crossed coming from the top on August 18th. 

3. High Inflation has a negative impact on big partners like Amazon and Walmart which might also negatively impact Plug Power

&amp;#x200B;

I might be totally wrong because I don't have any experience yet and there are a bunch of indicators i didn't take into consideration because I simply don't know them and I can't read them properly (not sure how relevant the mentioned are for this case and if I read and interpreted them correctly either) but for me it looks like there are some bucks to make by buying a short position.

Any thoughts on that? Does any of this makes sense? I would be glad about some input from experienced traders."

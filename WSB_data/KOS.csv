1,2015-09-14,Oshkosh Jan 16 Calls,u/MyDogShitsTigers,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3kyjdk/oshkosh_jan_16_calls/,"Sup wsb,

I'm here today to pitch the possibility of a great options call for Oshkosh Corp (OSK). These are the guys that were just awarded a $6.7 billion contract by the US gov for their new military humvees. The stock price rose about $6 when this was announced, and has dropped ~$2 since.

A few days ago, [Lockheed Martin appealed the contract decision on the grounds that the US didn't fairly give their humvee a shot](http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/land/vehicles/2015/09/08/lockheed-martin-jltv-protest-army-oshkosh/71893762/). The military has 100 days to respond. In the past, the decision has not been overturned about 80% of the time. The decision will be announced some time on or before Dec 17th, 2015. If OSK does well, there's also the possibility of the contract increasing to $30 billion, with additional humvees needed.

The asking price for a $40 Jan 16 call right now is about $3.80. Some firms have the price target as high as $48 for the near future. I predict it will go to at least $45 after they are awarded the contract. So there you have it, an 80% chance of good news around Dec 17th should be enough to push them $4. This contract is also more than double their market cap of ~$3 billion."

Oshkosh [won a contract for 6.7 billion dollars](https://news.vice.com/article/oshkosh-bgosh-the-us-military-is-finally-replacing-the-humvee) a few months back, but Lockheed filed a protest for the contract. The government accountability office has 100 days (12/17/15) from the date of filing to respond to the protest.

This vote of confidence from the insiders is a really good sign that the December 17th deadline for the US Accountability Office is likely to rule in their favor. The decision can be made any time up to the deadline.

This is one long analysis so if you do not want to read in short, Oshkosh Corp. stock will rise. Long defense.

HUMVEE vs JLTV

Humvee was designed in 1980s and evolved as a tactical combat vehicle following the gulf war a d global war on terrorism beyond its original purpose as a soft bodied vehicle cover by water proofed tarp  to be used on military bases, recon and behind the enemy line. 

JLTV is a modern vehicle that addressed all the flaws that HUMVEE series have. It has 2 series, General Purpose Heavy Guns Carrier and Utility JLTV ( Status: green ) but its 2nd variant, Close Combat Weapons Carrier aka CCWC ( status: need modification on the top for faster reloading of TOW missile produced by Raytheon )

COST
Total humvees in US Military: 55,000
Soft bodied humvees are the majority as the cost of them range from cheapest 40,000$ to 90,000$ while the fully armed humvees cost 250,000$
JLTV is 300,000$ to 450,000$

To upgrade every single humvee to be fully armored cost hundred of billions as per upgrade would cost 100,000$

FLAWS

At the same time, HUMVEE engine designed in 1980s become Obsolete and US govt. becomes the only consumer of many of its engine parts as the price to fix or replace an engine increased year by year. Now, it costs more than the HUMVEE itself.

The US Military High Chain of Command frustrated by every single equipment like soft bodied humvee NOT being used outside military bases in Iraq, Afghan., other in convoy, patrol because the lower chain of commands and soldiers only utilise fully armored humvees vehicles such as Stryker, LMTVs,... against roadside bombs and asystematic warfare. Thus, a large swath of vehicles become useless while the Govt. budget could only partially upgraded some of them. 

HUMVEE could go max speed at 55mph as its engine allowed while JLTV powered by Duramax 6.6L V8 engine could go 77mph. That means JLTV could HAUL more weight while being armored.


Every single soldier has a 50 - 60 pounds rucksack aka backpack full of equipments needed. Ammo, food, and field tents ( by tents I do not mean hiking tent for a single person I mean tents that can be used to build field hospital, command post,etc.  Field tents in its compacted size is half a size of a normal car + a dozen hollow aluminium support beam + dozen ropes + wooden stakes. ) Thus, the NECESSARY of carrying more while keeping at a faster speed without needing a trailer compared to its predecessor. 

CONCLUSION

The JLTV will NOT be able completely replaced the humvees in next 20 years due to the large quantity in US Military inventory. However, it will provided Oshkosh Corp. a constant stream of income worth tens of millions of dollar per quarter. "

Ticker: KOS

Market Cap: $1.2B

Enterprise Value: $3.3B

Current Price: $2.91

Price Target: $6

Implied upside: 105% 

Potential catalyst: Energy Mini-Conference next week in Houston (March 10-12) &amp; oil price stabilization. 

Kosmos Energy Ltd. has had a rough week, exacerbated by the dip in oil prices over the Corona Virus. 

1. Kosmos expects to retain a higher interest in Mauritania and Senegal

Management made the strategic decision to retain a higher stake in its Mauritania and Senegal assets, by holding a larger stake in Tortue. Between the three hubs - Tortue, Birallah and Yakaar Teranga, KOS expected 30 mtpa of LNG capacity to be constructed. The company now expects to retain 5 mtpa of LNG exposure, primarily through a larger stake in Tortue while using the expected asset sales process to fund additional capital spend requirements. While KOS had previously targeted a sale of 20% of the asset (leaving them with a 10% ownership), targeting 5 mtpa of LNG implies the sale of ~13% of the assets (and retaining a ~17% stake). The sales process at Mauritania/Senegal is still in progress; management has seen discussions with different buyer pools including end users, utilities and supermajors.

2. Capital spend requirements to increase post drawdown of the BP carry

Management has pointed to the ~$500 mn BP capex carry ending in mid-2020, with Mauritania and Senegal capex of $250 mn in 2020 once this has been exhausted, but expects additional capex to be funded through its anticipated divestiture program. The capital budget guidance for 2020 of $325 mn to $375 mn does not include the capital for Mauritania and Senegal.

3. KOS provided a more positive update around its Ghana assets

Following negative implications for Kosmos Energy after its JV partner, Tullow, announced a production and resource downgrade at the TEN and Jubilee assets, management has indicated that the partners have since executed a gas handling expansion project, enabling higher gas throughput and ultimately, higher production levels. Production levels have now reached around 90 kbpd, with further work to improve gas compressor reliability to enable stable flows at this rate. KOS has also pointed the addition of a rig in 1H2020, to further underpin consistent production.

Buy it just do it. I’m sleepy and too lazy to explain why and honestly it doesn’t matter some retards here will buy it anyway. make profit and forget about me just like last time when I gave you shittards perfect trades. (virginG, BB, vale...)

How much to buy? Whatever your buying power is. If you are a pussy get 50-100-200... whatever you „want to risk“.

For those who gain a lot please make sure to share these gains because it’s not yours it’s mine! Donate food to poor people or buy your wife’s boyfriend something nice. In all honesty give an amount you are okay with to someone less fortunate otherwise I will be fucking pissed 

And do not doubt me it will moon you will profit just wait wait wait and let this bitch run I know y’all dumb cutting losses too late and taking profits too early... dm me when you want to take profits but not sure whether there is upwards potential. Don’t dm me before that I do not care about you and won’t give you any advice on anything 

Lastly the best way to buy for those low IQ bitches here with FOMO it won’t jump 200% in a day. It you want to get 500 shares buy 100 every day for 5 days. This way you retard won’t buy right at the fucking top like You do most of the Time."

46,2021-02-13,Oshkosh Corp. $OSK,u/Drewfus_,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lj4bl2/oshkosh_corp_osk/,"Is anyone else on the Oshkosh train in hopes they get the new deal with USPS?  You can do your own DD, but there are 3 companies left in the running for the new contract with USPS for new mail trucks. The other 2 companies have electric trucks in the running but Oshkosh has one with a diesel motor in it.  From what I’ve read more than one company may be chosen so I’m banking that they will go with an electric and gas option, which means Oshkosh would be chosen having the only combustion engine offered. There are lots of rural areas across the country where electric wouldn’t be the best option. Also, the fact that Oshkosh already has contracts with the US Government making specialty trucks and military vehicles, seems to be an added benefit. 

USPS is scheduled to make an announcement in the first quarter of this year and long calls on $OSK are still fairly cheap. Just wondering what others think about what appears to be a golden opportunity?

I’m no expert on the stock market and this is my first post here as I’m new to trading.  I don’t think I can really go wrong with this company given their diversity of products and long stable history. Also, the fact that I lost so much money to GME, I feel like I have gotten my big burn out of the way! Let me know what you think!"

I have also put TLDR's in the beginning because I know you are all lazy cunts.

TLDR (Full Series): Oshkosh is a boomer company with the Pilot, Rocket, and Jet Fuel to take off to infinity and beyond. It has the resources allowing it to dominate in its current market and propel it to the hottest market of them all (EV). It has a small downside, but its upside is so massive that the green dildo will tear my ass apart.

TLDR (Part 2): Oshkosh’s current operative sectors are currently printing cash for the business. It has a strong debt to asset ratio with a TTM Free cashflow of 328M. This gives them a lot of room for R&amp;D in the commercial electric vehicle space without diluting shares or taking on massive debt. In other words, they have fuck you money to go against competitors looking to get into the commercial EV space. A large portion of their current revenue comes from municipalities and government entities, so they have mastered the art of lobbing and government contracts \***USPS\***)

Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor of any sort. This is my opinion, and it should not be taken as the word of God. Full disclosure, I am also fucking retarded, and it is better if you listen to a monkey and the apes than myself.

Oshkosh’s Rocket Ship will take us beyond the Universe.

In my last post **(**[**Part 1**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liixp0/osk_oshkosh_to_infinity_and_beyond_part_1/)**)**, I discussed the management of the business, and why they have the track record to continually grow the company. It was fairly short as the numbers essentially spoke for themselves. This post will be focused on the business of Oshkosh in terms of its products and financial strength.

To reiterate, Oshkosh is a manufacturing conglomerate in the sectors of access equipment, defense, fire &amp; emergency, and commercial. The 2021 Q1 revenue for each sector is 563.7M, 550.3M, 273.9M, and 195.7M respectively. I have attached a [diagram](https://imgur.com/a/iajdpei) to show the breakdown of the sectors. As shown on the diagram, the largest money makers for Oshkosh are Access equipment and Defense, comprising 35.6% and 34.7% of the revenue respectively. Fire &amp; emergency consists of 17.3%, and the commercial sector consists of 12.4%. (Look at the diagram, it’s easier to comprehend)

The business diversification shows that Oshkosh has a healthy revenue across different sectors, meaning that it does not have all its eggs in one basket. This was evident with Covid hitting. Although the revenue of Oshkosh was affected negatively, it was balanced out in different sectors. For example, the 2021 Q1 revenue for the Access equipment sector decreased by 21.5% and the Commercial sector fell by 12.7% compared to 2020. However, the total change in revenue only decreased by approximately 7% because the Defense and Fire &amp; Emergency business grew. This shows that there is a small downside risk to Oshkosh. The source is taken from Q1 [presentations ](https://s24.q4cdn.com/975203404/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Q1-2021-Earnings-Slides-FINAL.pdf)from Oshkosh. Q4 2020 numbers will show a bigger dip in revenue, but you get the point. The business isn’t reliant on one type of business, and the management team was able to adapt quickly and bounce back.

(TDLR Paragraph: Certain manufacturing sectors were affected by Covid, but Oshkosh was able to withstand the hit due to different businesses. This means that it is hard to wipe this business out.)

(Skip this if you don’t care about each business sector.)

Oshkosh’s Access Equipment business is under JLG and a variety of brands, and it essential manufactures different types of lifts for the construction market. What is exciting about this business is that they have an all-electric scissor lift that was recently just released. This shows that Oshkosh is innovating, and looking to transition from offering only diesel products to electric products. Moreover, it shows that they are capable of it.

The Defense sector brings in a lot of money for Oshkosh, and it does not seem to be slowing down. They received an order for $911 million in 2021 Q1 alone. Moreover, they have a large backlog that will continue to pump cash into the business. There were arguments from my last post that Oshkosh has trouble fulfilling some orders. This was due to staffing challenges related to Covid. However, according to them, they were able to ramp up production successfully even with the setbacks. If they weren’t doing a decent job fulfilling orders, they would not get large orders like this.

(**Read: Oshkosh is constantly getting orders for the military sector. The military sector is related to government bids and contracts. This shows that Oshkosh has the experience and capability to win contracts with the government. Lobbying plays a big part, and this shows they are dammed good at it.\* USPS contract\***)

Oshkosh’s Fire &amp; Emergency essentially creates fire trucks for municipalities. They achieved new record orders in FY2020. Additionally, they just released a new vehicle. They claim that backlog remains near-record level, meaning that they have a bunch of demand for the product that needs to be filled. Usually, that means it is a great business with a great product. Again, winning over government contracts is apart of their business model. This is their bread and butter. If there is any doubt that they can even get a piece of the USPS contract, this should crush that.

The Commercial sector consists of a bunch of different brands under Oshkosh. The commercial sector for Oshkosh has taken a hit due to Covid. However, they still have a backlog of $361 million. They offer a lot of great products that are required by commercial businesses and government entities.

Now that we are done going through each business that Oshkosh is in, we are going to dive into some financials, and they look good. I retrieved these numbers on yahoo finance. Look them up if you don’t believe it. (Disclaimer: these are approximate %). The Debt to Asset ratio for Oshkosh is **14%**. For people who are retarded and autistic, like me, and don’t know if that’s good, Workhorse has a debt to asset ratio of **102%**. No, larger percentages don’t mean it is better. Workhorse is leveraged up the ass, and if they don’t bring in some revenue, they are fucked so hard it is not even going to be funny. Their high leverage gives them little room for error. They aren't able to make many mistakes without sinking the ship. Compared to Workhorse, Oshkosh’s low debt to asset ratio allows them to invest in current business growth, new business ventures, and new products (eg. EV) without the fear of sinking the ship. They have already been doing this by investing in Microvast (🐝 🐝 🐝 ) and setting up a joint venture. I will get more into this in the next part.

**(For the people who are going to say debt is going to R&amp;D and growth, fuck you. Workhorse’s revenue is for 2020 is $570 thousand. My wife’s allowance from her boyfriend is more than that.)** Workhorse’s cost of revenue is $5,845,000 while Oshkosh’s is $6,031,600,000. Based on just this number, it doesn’t look too bad, but it is horrendous. Basically, Workhorse is investing $15 to bring $1 in revenue (that is a -93.3% ROI). Oshkosh’s revenue is $7,268,300,000, and that gives us an ROI of 20%. This is purely revenue returns of course.

With the current business sectors' support, Oshkosh has a TTM Free Cashflow of $328M. This gives them room to either pay down their debts, which isn’t high. More importantly, this gives them room to grow into the EV space where they can continue to create products for their Commercial and Municipal customers. They can create the products, infrastructure, and sales teams without worrying about running out of cash. Just for a comparison, Workhorse has a TTM Free Cashflow of -$38.977M.

Oshkosh is a very old business that has great products with great numbers. One of the downsides that I can think of for this business is that they somehow lose all their current business. This is very unlikely because they were able to maintain strong numbers even with Covid. This was due to the management and the employees being able to adapt quickly during hard times, which is the reason **(**[**Part 1**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liixp0/osk_oshkosh_to_infinity_and_beyond_part_1/)**)** was only about management competence. They are constantly releasing new products that are in high demand with large backorders.

I know what you’re thinking. Having great historical numbers isn’t going to guarantee growth in the future. It’s about innovation and the new type of business. However, the company is thinking about the future, and that is why they are looking to use their excess cash to develop commercial products in the EV space. What makes this an exciting play is the company is great at procuring government contracts. This is an art form that they have an advantage over new players in the EV space. You cannot disregard the importance of Lobby in winning contracts like the USPS. I will talk more about why Oshkosh is primed for growth based on the EV hype that other companies are receiving in Part 3

The main goal of Part 2 of this DD is to illustrate why the downside for this company is extremely low compared to a play like Workhorse. Workhorse will essentially need to dilute its shares for more cash, which decreases the value of the shares you bought. The reason is that it can’t leverage any more debt because it already has more debt than assets.

(Stay Tuned for Part 3. These take a fucking long time.)

Why is Jinkosolar a good buy you ask? It’s only the  world leading solar panel manufacturer , valued at only 1.8 B $. That is only \~30% of their actual revenue.

Sounds good? It gets even better.

Chances  are high, that “Die Grünen”, which literally translates to “The  Greens”, a german political party which is all about protecting the  environment, will be elected into government this summer.

There are laws in the making which would  force every homeowner to install solar panels   on their roofs.

Why  is this important for Jinko? There are virtually no solar panel  manufacturers left in Germany since the big solar bust some years ago,  so we are dependant on foreign goods on this one. And since Jinko has  the best performing modules and already has a strong presence and  network in Europe, they will get a big slice of that juicy cake.

Next let’s take a look at the insitutions and short interest. Of course  Blackrock is riding in on this one, because they love making money. The short interest grew to a  whopping 21%  over the last months, which is not extraordinary high but plenty of potential to squeeze. And guess who is on board? Citadel. This is all public info which you can lookup at fintel.

Can you really afford not to invest in the biggest, badassest green stock of our time?

TL;DR : Jinko 🌞 good for planet and 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"

**FEAR NOT AND LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT JINKOSOLAR**

Disclaimer: I am by no means a financial expert, this is not financial advice and I once looked for my headphones while listening to music with them.

First things first: What the fuck is a Jinko?

Only the biggest friggin Solarpanel manufacturer, that’s what. At this very moment they supply **THE** **WHOLE PLANET** (excluding Antarctica I think) with **TOP OF THE LINE SOLAR JUICE**. They are literally **milking** the sun.

Boring stuff first to get it over with? Sure

**1: Technical Analysis**

TA is like astrology for “”rational grownups”, it works until it doesn’t. Still we can deduce certain developments and in the end only need to trick the algos. So here is a picture

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5cwojf3sug471.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=978b4f6e2b8c382247dacf8b28c37546e57f22b1

What is this shit and what does it mean?

The top picture shows the most recent downtrend, **WHICH JUST GOT FUCKING BROKEN** and the, still valid older downtrend from mid last year. The top red line is the next target, which would be \~ 60$ or almost 50% above current shareprice. If this gets broken too there are clear skies ahead, which is always good for solar 🌻.

The second picture is the MACD, ~~which means Macdonalds~~, which basically means when the line moves from below the center to above the center it’s a bullish signal. Since this just seems to be occurring one could speculate that this will start a **MASSIVE BONKERS BULLRUN**.

The last picture is the RSI and I included it because it looks pretty.

Are you bored yet? It gets worse before it gets better.

**2: THE NUMBERS MASON WHAT DO THEY MEAN**

Just looking at numbers alone won’t give you a good indication if a stock is performing well, is undervalued yada yada. Nice boy that I am I compared some metrics between Jinko and competition for you, in Excel like the **fucking nerd I am**.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wzzipat5vg471.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c0cd1c824df9c9ccb8a5aa9274381fba9533f5b

As you may have noticed, Jinko **ABSOLUTELY DESTROYS** those 2 other guys in sales but is a **LITTLE BITCH** when it comes to profits and market cap. Why is that, am I retarded for recommending this bullshit to you? *Maybe.*

Then again, a closer look to the expenses reveal that most of the sales-money goes to SG&amp;A, which is just administrative overhang in a company, think of salespeople, the janitor, the low level support who watches stocks all day on their phone. Why do they have so much of these? **BECAUSE THEY ARE ON LITERALLY EVERY CONTINENT ON THE EARTH.** Seriously, look it up. Australia, Middle-East, Asia, Europe, Africe, both Americas. They have locations everywhere. And customers are pleased, I’ll tell you that.

You know who else expanded everywhere aggressively in their history? It starts with A and ends with 1 day delivery. The other problem is that Jinko relies heavily on materials for producing, especially silicone. I think you know that this shit is expensive right now. So what do they do? Like the **GIGACHADS** they are they are actively acquiring mining companies so they don’t have to pay stupid premiums.

https://preview.redd.it/izpet1cdvg471.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=066908e318a77a46a964cbb9a7326e7375321850

**THEY ARE VALUED AT NOT EVEN HALF THEIR SALES! YOU CAN'T FIND THIS ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE SOLAR SECTOR**

**3: BULLCASE**

So what’s next for Jinko, why would the stock rise at all? I already talked about expansion and being independent from material producers. Let me tell you about something going on in the heart of europoor country, Germany.

Chances are high, that “Die Grünen”, which literally translates to “The Greens”, a german political party which is all about protecting the environment, will be elected into government this summer. There are laws in the making which would force every homeowner to install solar panels on their roofs. Why is this important for Jinko? There are virtually no solar panel manufacturers left in Germany since the big solar bust some years ago, so we are dependant on foreign goods on this one. And since Jinko has the best performing modules and already has a strong presence and network in Europe, they will get a big slice of that juicy cake.

Next let’s look at their products, the panels themselves. **AT THIS VERY MOMENT** you can buy the world’s #7 panel from Jinko regarding efficiency at 20,2% for 0,76$ / W. Compare that to #1, which has a measily 2,2% more efficiency for DOUBLE the price. Are they stupid? That’s not all though, Jinko recently achieved a whopping 25,25% efficiency on their upcoming product line. You heard that right, we can soon suck off daddy sun for 1/4th of his output **( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)**.

Let’s not forget sleepy joe on this one. He promised a fat green deal. I bet my left asscheeck that solar will be included.

They recently appointed a new CFO, who himself has an extensive record in the solar industry. He worked at Canadian Solar (which is also a good stock to look at). They did that to prepare for the STAR listing which is basically the NYSE in Shanghai. Chinese people have very limited access to the stock markets, now they can get in on this beautiful dragon.

**4: BEARCASE**

I am not here to deceive you precious donkeys. No DD is complete without looking at the dark side.

There is obviously the **CHYNA** Factor at play here. Go watch “The China Hustle” if you want to know why Wallstreet is shy when it comes to Chinese stocks. It doesn’t really apply to Jinko since they are not just a doghouse in the middle of nowhere valued at millions, but psychology is a bitch. Also, trade wars, cold wars, hot wars, world of warcraft is all on the table. What troublesome times we live in.

Next is the issue with slave labour. There are concerns that parts of the materials used are extracted in regions where the Uyghurs are abused and mistreated and possibly used as modern slaves. I am not there and can neither verify or deny those claims but its good to keep in mind.

Also stock market doing stock market things. You never know.

**5: SAY THE LINE BART**

I am hesitant to use it, but it is what it is. Guess who is short on the biggest, badassest Solarpanelmanufacturer on the planet? Our favourite hedgeguy.

YFW you find out who is messing around again

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c9lxer5qvg471.png?width=1387&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f17567768eeabcfca211dc8447ac8222e19b319

I hope I didn’t bore you to death. I don't want this to be the next P&amp;D. In my opinion there is just gigantic upside which has so far been overlooked by the """"efficient Market"""". Make your own choice.

TL;DR: At current cap, this stock is fucking undervalued and the market begins to notice. Have some rockets.

[Video tracking plane here - if not processed yet you can download original file below video and play](https://emalm.com/?v=-OdSp)

I’ll break down the significance for all you retards here.

Oshkosh won the usps next generation delivery vehicles contract for all the new trucks.  They are going to be making a good majority of these as EVs using batteries.  The award is an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract, meaning that after an initial dollar commitment, the Postal Service will have the ongoing ability to order more NGDV over a fixed period of time, in this case,10 years.

101,2021-08-26,My DD on $OSK OSHKOSH and why it will LOSE the Lawsuit - Check out Info About the Judge!!!,u/slbabogado,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pcdvop/my_dd_on_osk_oshkosh_and_why_it_will_lose_the/,"I like money. You like money. We like money. So check out what my DD tell me what you think...

First of all, $OSK is a huge company, and not immune from being shorted. Most if not everyone knows that $OSK is being sued by a company who says that basically they were awarded a multi billion dollar federal contract in error. So, in my opinion, I think Oshkosh $OSK is perfect for being shorted. Let me explain my reasons why, because they involve the Judge handling the lawsuit right now.

Let me introduce you all to Judge Zachary Somers.  Most notable here is that Judge Somers was appointed by Trump in Dec. 2020, so he has been a judge for a very short time. This is important because it means he has only been handling cases at the court for a short time so it is hard to know how he interprets the Constitution. Without getting into a long-winded discussion, the theory in law is that different judges have different perspectives about the Constitution, some believe the words apply literally the same today as they did before, some others think the Constitution changes and adapts to modern society. The point is that the best way to get an idea of how a judge might rule on an issue is by looking at PAST DECISIONS the judge has made in other cases that maybe involved similar issues. Even if those cases are not precedent cases (meaning a case that can be cited as an authority that applies to all the judges in a court), again, by looking at the cases, you can tell maybe what way a judge leans on certain issues, including the Constitution.

Now Judge Somers has some decisions posted on the Claims Court website.  In one case, believe it or not, Judge Somers RULED IN FAVOR OF THE PLAINTIFF IN A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT INVOLVING AN AWARD OF A ARMY TRAVEL CONTRACT. Basically, the GSA awarded an Army contract after bids were submitted to a company, but another company filed a lawsuit, arguing that the GSA had abused its discretion and made key errors that caused it to lose out on the contract. DOES THAT SOUND FAMILIAR TO ANYONE????? Anyways, Judge Somers granted an injunction and ordered the contract award be stopped. The Judge ordered the bids be re-evaluated in a manner consistent with the Judge's opinion and order, and the Plaintiff won!!!

So clearly, those who doubt that Judge Somers is the kind of person that would halt a government contract need not doubt anymore, because again, he just recently did that in a different government contract dispute case. Now does that mean Workhorse wins? No, of course not, BUT the fact the Judge has shown a willingness to rule in favor of a plaintiff in a government contract dispute has to make us feel better about Workhorse's chances, right?

Now, I know I have written ALOT about the Appointments Clause. So I do not want to go too much into it in this post, but I have read some Reddit comments that doubt the argument because they doubt Judge Somers would consider it in favor of Workhorse.

WELL........YUP.........I FOUND SOMETHING THAT MAKES ME BELIEVE JUDGE SOMERS WOULD TOTALLY BUY INTO THE APPOINTMENTS CLAUSE (AC) ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF WORKHORSE. Here is why, please CHECK OUT THE LAW SCHOOL ARTICLE THAT Judge Somers wrote back in Law School in 2004 in Georgetown. The title of the article is ""The Mythical Wall of Separation: How the Supreme Court has Amended the Constitution."" Judge Somers wrote this article when he was editor of the Georgetown Law Review. I PRINTED IT OUT, READ IT, AND THE LINK ABOVE GIVES YOU ACCESS TO IT, ALTHOUGH YOU MAY HAVE TO PAY FOR IT. I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO UPLOAD A FULL DOCUMENT LINK ON REDDIT, SO I WILL SEE IF ANOTHER WORKHORSE APE CAN HELP ME WITH THAT.

Anyways, the article is long and full of legal language. But I will give you my summary about it, and again, if you doubt it, please get the article, it is available but has to be purchased at this point until I figure out how (or even if) I can upload it.

Judge Somers (or rather, student Zachary Somers at the time), wrote an article criticizing the Supreme Court because it had created its own interpretation of the Establishment Clause (EC) of the Constitution. The EC says the Government can't create a national religion or church, so it protects separation of church and state and free religious exercise. However, in 1947, the Supreme Court decided a case called EVERSON involving the EC. Zachary Somers wrote that the EVERSON case was wrong because it had ignored the original text of the EC, what the framers of the Constitution intended it to mean. He cites what England thought the EC meant, and even what Madison and Jefferson thought the EC should mean. MOST IMPORTANTLY IN HIS CONCLUSION, Zachary Somers says that we should go back to the original meaning of the EC, what conservatives want, and that we should not allow court's to change the interpretation intended by the Framers of the Constitution.

THIS.....IS....WHY.....I.....AM.....EXCITED!!!!!

Because think about everyone, the Appointments Clause is OLD SCHOOL CONSTITUTION LAW, like OLD SCHOOL, and I can tell you, the Framers did not intend for the AC to be construed differently, it was supposed to be construed as it is written, the PRESIDENT has to appoint, SENATE confirm, and lower officers follow a procedure in accordance with the AC. THE CURRENT USPS SCHEME DOES NOT AT ALL CONFORM TO WHAT THE FRAMERS INTENDED, NOT....ONE....BIT....

And yes, just because Zachary Somers law student thought this way does not mean Judge Somers thinks this way. But see, I get the feeling that the judge WANTS to make a decision, and WANTS TO MAKE A STATEMENT THAT IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPOINTMENTS CLAUSE because again, he has already shown a willingness to go against the government in a contract dispute in that unpublished case I included, AND he was taking time away from partying and having crazy law school threesomes to write a boring ass law review article about the freakin' Establishment Clause, I mean, damn, think about how boring that must have been for him.

So with that said, I think right now is a perfect time to short Oshkosh. No way they are holding on to that full contract, and if they settle, even if it is a 50/50 split, the stock loses a good amount. Also, what if the Judge denies the motion to dismiss and makes $OSK think they will lose the whole contract? It might make them give up more than a 50/50 split.

So yeah, do whatever you think is best, I am not a financial advisor, this is not legal advice, I honestly can't even get an Ubereats order correct, but do your own DD and jump in!!!!!!"

https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/workhorse-voluntarily-dismisses-its-legal-challenge-usps-contract-2021-09-15/

This means Oshkosh gets the order and there is no longer a legal challenge and they can move forward with their plans.

Oshkosh is a pipe investor with Microvast and an R&amp;D partner on batteries.
https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210205005089/en/Microvast-Enters-Electrification-Joint-Development-Agreement-With-Oshkosh-Corporation

When initial contract win was awarded to Oshkosh, that day Microvast spiked to $25.

Microvast built a factory in Clarksville, TN to deliver on its largest order yet, and did this on request of the DOE.

Currently Microvast has roughly 7-8 million shares shorted according to Ortex.  This is at least 3 days on average volume to cover all those shares (if every share traded was covering). 

The S1 locking up shares of Microvast pipe investors and insiders has not been made effective yet by the SEC so those shares are still locked up and that means that currently the public tradable float of around 21-22 million shares for Microvast.

This means that currently 7-8 million of the 21-22 million public float (31-36%) is currently being shorted. (Note:  This is until S1 is made effective and it could be a little while since this is first S1 and there are issues with it probably needs to be amended)

With this recent news which did not come out until after market close, tomorrow and next few days could be very interesting for Microvast (MVST)."

2,2022-02-28,JinkoSolar (JKS) is literally free money.,u/TylerInHiFi,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t3nhzi/jinkosolar_jks_is_literally_free_money/,"Alright, idiots, listen up. Green energy is back on the menu. Sure, you could make boomer gains with oil or things that go boom right now, but why the fuck would you want to do that when you could be Oprah rich from some bits of glass that make the electricity that charges your wife’s robot boyfriend’s batteries? She’s living in the future, so should you. 


I’m not going to bore you with some bullshit ~~stock bro astrology~~ technical analysis. Because I’m too fucking stupid to understand any of that anyway. Instead I’m going to hit you with some basic math. 


A month ago, JinkoSolar IPO’d a subsidiary on the Shanghai exchange. They listed 42% of the company and it’s got a market cap and enterprise value both of +/- $18 billion USD. JKS has a market cap, today, of only $2.1 billion on the NYSE. 


Now, I’m no mathemagician but that doesn’t make any fucking sense. How does a company “worth” $2.1 billion own 58% of *another* company “worth” $18 billion? It doesn’t make sense at all, right? Now, because stocks only go up, I see three outcomes here:


**SCENARIO 1: Easy Gains**

JKS owns 58% of a company worth $18 billion. Their stake is worth $10.4 billion, give or take. Their own market cap should be 4-5x what it is today, putting them at $200-250 a share. 


**SCENARIO 2:** 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀


So we all agree stocks only go up, right? Good. And I think we can all agree that valuations are made up and the technicals don’t matter. Perfect. In that case JKS owns 58% of a company worth $18 billion, and if we value JKS at the same as their Shanghai subsidiary, *plus* the fact that they actually own that company, JKS is up to $420.69 share. More like $400, but why let your dreams be memes right?


**SCENARIO 3: I’m a fucking idiot**


Let’s be honest, this is a real possibility. Get your June 17 $20 puts while they’re cheap. 




**BONUS SCENARIO**


This one’s for the idiots in the back even dumber than me. JKS has a small float, and 69% of the total shares held by insiders and institutions (nice). As of January 31, there were 4 million shares sold short, up from 3.4 million at the end of December. If this starts to run, you can all piss and shit about a sHoRt SqUeEzE for old time’s sake. JKS $900 is not a meme.^((it probably is, though\)) Here’s some more rocket emojis for you degenerate apes: 🚀🚀🚀🚀



**TLDR:** JKS is undervalued based on their Shanghai subsidiary’s market cap alone. Easy money. Can’t go tits up. 🚀🚀🚀🚀Unless I’m a complete fucking idiot, which is entirely possible. 



Positions: 42 JKS at $51.58 because i’m not fucking with options and i’m kind of a little bitch so I don’t want to go all-in. Although it does represent my entire USD trading account, which is my fuckit savings that isn’t in boomer ETF’s and AAPL. 


**EDIT BONUS SCENARIO 2: Enterprise Value Boogaloo**


JKS has an enterprise value of $6.22 billion, $7.04 billion in cash, and a per-share book value of $229.14. *Literally* cannot go tits up. Just based on enterprise value, JKS is worth $150 a share because I passed middle school math classes and know that 6.22 / 2.1 ≈ basically 3, and 3 x 50 = 150. Checkmate, past me who said I’d never need math out in the real world."

So how can you play this minor potential onion shortage? You can't, because its illegal to trade in onion futures due to Vinnie Kosuga. Due to a successful corner of the onion market by Vincent Kosuga and Sam Seigel in 1955, in which they made millions of dollars by buying up 98% the onions available on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange a through futures contracts, driving the price sky high, and then buying puts on said onions and tricking traders into thinking massive amounts of onions were being injected into the market by moving freightcars of onions around. Prices crashed, causing various onion farmers to go bankrupt and a subsequent real onion shortage occured. [After the onion market crash and Kosuga's hijinks, Congress decided to pass the Onion Futures Act which made trading in onion futures illegal in the united states.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_Futures_Act)"
